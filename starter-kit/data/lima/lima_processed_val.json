{"prompt":"Three months ago, I submitted a manuscript to one of the most respected journals in my field. Today, I received comments from reviewers stating that my paper is not worth publishing in the journal. However, the editor decided to give it a major revision instead of outright rejection. Should I proceed to address all the questions posed by reviewers or should I just withdraw the paper and submit it elsewhere to save time?","response":"Based on the description, I would advise you to sleep on it, suck it up, respond to the reviewers, revise the paper, and submit your revision to the journal.\nYes, reviewers can be absolutely, disgustingly, and unnecessarily rude and mean. Read their review, filter their non-technical rants, keep whatever helpful criticism you can extract from their comments, and address them nicely and respectfully. It may actually be that the techniques you used were adequate but you failed to point out why and how it would be unnecessary to use more expensive methods. Always assume that they are right. If they are mistaken, respectfully point out in your response why you are right and edit the original manuscript to make the issue clearer to future readers.\n\nFor instance, if the reviewer wrote:\n\n> The methods used in the paper are abysmal. The authors use an outdated and archaic method, which is also very uncertain, to measure the mass of the frogs, which is by weighting them on a scale. The atomic mass interferometer, which uses gravitational waves and is able to precisely infer mass with an uncertainty of one atomic mass unit per kilogram, is the state of the art in weighting.\n\nYou can write as a response:\n\n* The reviewer is absolutely correct that atomic mass interferometry (AMI) is the state of the art in weighting. However, we opted to use analytical scales to measure the mass of the frogs because the mass variations that we expected to measure are of at least 1 g, a quantity signficantly higher than the uncertainty of even the most rudimentary analytical scales. We do, however, agree, that the quantum mechanical analysis of the molecular buildup in neural entangled channels in during frog electrophoresis, which is suggested as an interesting prospective investigation, will benefit from the low uncertainty provided by AMI. In order to make it clear that the methods used in our study were adequate, we have modified the original manuscript to include the following sentence in the second paragraph of page 5: While there are more precise methods to infer mass, such as atomic mass interferometry, analytical scales offer accuracies that are compatible with the 1 g mass variations that were found in this study (see Table 3, for instance)."}

{"prompt":"How to prepare for a vaginoplasty?","response":"A vaginoplasty is a surgical procedure that reconstructs or tightens the outer and inner muscles of your vagina, which can become weak and loose over time. It may improve your comfort levels and symptoms of incontinence. Some even claim it can boost sexual pleasure though this is not well studied and highly individual. A vaginoplasty can also create a vagina if you're undergoing gender-affirming surgery. You can prepare for a vaginoplasty by visiting your doctor, arranging your surgery, planning your recovery, and following pre-op requirements. For gender affirming surgery, you'll work with your doctor to prepare for surgery.\n\n## Visit your doctor\n\n1. Talk to your doctor about the procedure. Your doctor can fully explain the procedure, as well as what you can expect afterward. They'll also discuss the risks of the surgery. Tell your doctor why you want the surgery so that they can help you avoid disappointment. The doctor will ask about your health and well-being before approving you for the procedure. Bring a detailed medical history, including conditions you're being treated for. Tell the doctor if you're seeing a therapist. If you're undergoing treatment for a condition related to your decision to get a vaginoplasty, such as body image issues, it's best to tell the doctor. Provide the doctor with a list of any medications you're taking, including the dosage amounts. Ask about your needs post-surgery. This includes what you should expect at the hospital and during the days after the surgery.\n2. Get a blood test. Your doctor will want to do a few simple tests to make sure you're healthy enough for surgery. First, they'll do a simple blood test, which is virtually painless. This lets them check your hemoglobin and health profile to ensure that you are healthy. They may also do a pregnancy test, as you won't be able to get a vaginoplasty if you're pregnant.\n3. Undergo a urine test. The doctor will also do a urinalysis to make sure that you're healthy. This is a simple, painless test. You'll just need to urinate in a cup, and the medical staff will take care of the rest!\n4. Confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't want more kids. You should not get a vaginoplasty if you want to have more children or if you're pregnant. In this case, it's best for you to wait until you're finished having children. Your doctor will likely ask you to confirm that you aren't pregnant and don't plan to become pregnant. The doctor may also choose to do a pregnancy test before allowing you to get the surgery.\n\n\n## Arrange your surgery\n\n1. Contact your insurance provider to check your coverage. Many insurance companies won't cover a vaginoplasty, as it's usually considered an elective procedure. This means you may have to pay for it out of pocket. If you're not sure you can afford the procedure, ask your doctor if they offer a payment plan. You can also look into CareCredit, a line of credit opened specifically for elective medical procedures. CareCredit requires an application similar to that of most credit cards.\n2. Make a budget for how you'll pay for the procedure. Factor in the cost of the procedure, your pre-op and follow-up appointments, pharmacy costs, and the time you'll need to take off work. Determine where you'll get the money, such as from savings or by borrowing. Some of your appointments could be covered by insurance, so you may not need to pay these out of pocket. In the United States, a vaginoplasty typically costs between $4,500 and $8,500.\n3. Plan the surgery in between menstrual periods if applicable. You cannot get a vaginoplasty while you're on your period. The best time to have the surgery is right after your period, which allows you as much recovery time as possible before your next period starts.\n4. Take photos of your genitals before the surgery. Your doctor may also want a set of photos. This allows you and your doctor to see the difference before and after your surgery.\n5. Make your surgical appointment. It usually takes several months to a year from your initial consultation to get your surgery. You should find out your surgery date about 2-3 months before it will occur. Your doctor can provide you more information about your unique case.\n\n\n## Plan your recovery\n\n1. Schedule time off of work. You'll need at least a few days to recover, but how long you should take off depends on your job demands. It's a good idea to request at least a calendar week. If your job is very physically demanding, you may want to take off longer. Ask your doctor how long you should take off. If you'll lose part of your income, make a special budget to help you cover your living costs.\n2. Ask someone to come help you. You'll need help as soon as your surgery is over. Someone will need to drive you home and help you take care of your needs. This includes getting any additional medications, preparing meals, helping care for pets, and completing household chores. It's best to arrange this help ahead of time. If possible, recruit a few friends or loved ones to act as a support system following your surgery. You can also hire a professional home-care nurse to help you in the days following your procedure.\n3. Create a pain treatment plan to make your recovery easier. It's normal to experience some pain after surgery, but luckily it's possible to minimize it. Planning beforehand can make it easier to treat your pain so that your recovery goes as smoothly and as painlessly as possible. Discuss pain medicine with your doctor. Obtain an over-the-counter pain reliever, if recommended. Ask your doctor if a prescription pain reliever might be right for you. You could also purchase a heating pad or single-use heat packs to help manage your pain.\n4. Stock your fridge and freezer with healthy, easy to prepare meals. Cooking will be hard following surgery, so it's a good idea to have lots of easy options at home. You could make meals ahead of time or use commercial microwaveable dinners. Alternatively, you could have someone cook for you, if this is an option.\n5. Plan mood boosters for your downtime. After your surgery, you'll need to take a break from regular life for a few days. Gather a few activities to occupy your mind during this time, like a book, coloring book, or favorite TV show. It's a good idea to collect a few easy-to-access options so that it's easier to keep your mood up while you recover. Check out a few new releases from the library. Get an adult coloring book or download a coloring app. Add a new comedy to your watchlist on your favorite streaming site. Place your iPad and other devices, including chargers, near your recovery area for easy access.\n6. Purchase menstruation pads if you're still menstruating. You won't be able to use a tampon or menstrual cup for 4-6 weeks after your surgery. Menstruation pads are an easy alternative while you're in recovery. Ask your doctor before you resume using tampons or a menstrual cup. Your muscles must be healed before these methods are an option for you.\n7. Talk to your partner about sex after the surgery. You'll need to avoid sex for 4-6 weeks while your vagina heals. Make sure your partner understands this wait, and discuss ways you two can be intimate without having sex. Visit your doctor for a check-up before you engage in sexual activity. The doctor needs to examine your vagina and clear you for sex.\n\n\n## Follow pre-op recommendations\n\n1. Stop taking aspirin and blood thinners 1 week prior to surgery. All surgeries increase your bleeding risk. Blood thinners can further increase this risk by making it harder for your blood to clot. Over-the-counter aspirin or ibuprofen pain relievers can thin your blood, so you shouldn't take them before your surgery. You may also need to stop taking vitamins and supplements. Tell your doctor what you're taking so that they can advise you. If you are taking a prescription blood thinner, talk to your doctor about when you should decrease your dosage. Don't stop taking it until you talk to your doctor.\n2. Avoid smoking in the weeks before your surgery. Smoking can slow your recovery time. This is because it narrows your veins and makes it harder for blood to flow. This means that your blood isn't able to effectively deliver oxygen throughout your body, which is necessary during recovery. Your doctor may decide to check your urine to make sure that you have quit. It's best to stop smoking at least 8 weeks prior to having your surgery.\n3. Shave your genital area before surgery. This makes it easier for the doctor to complete the procedure. It can also reduce your chance of infection. If you don't shave the area beforehand, the medical team may do it prior to beginning your operation.\n4. Follow your pre-op procedures. The doctor will instruct you on what to do in the days leading up to the surgery. The day before surgery, you may be instructed to fast. It's best to eat a hearty breakfast that morning, as the rest of the day you may only be allowed clear liquids. Your pre-op plan may also include the following:\n\t* A bowel cleanse\n\t* Fasting, with clear liquids\n\t* Drinking more than 8 glasses of water\n\t* Rest\n\t* Nothing ingested by mouth after the midnight prior to surgery\n5. Do relaxation techniques to cope with stress or worry. It's normal to worry before undergoing surgery. It's a good idea to spend some time relaxing the night before the surgery. Perform deep breathing exercises. Meditate. Stretch or do yoga. Color in an adult coloring book or app. Go for a walk outdoors if the weather is nice. Soak in a warm bath.\n6. Plan for an overnight stay at the hospital. You may be able to leave the hospital a few hours after your surgery, but many doctors will hold you overnight. Pack an overnight bag with a change of clothes, a light robe, slippers, and any toiletries you think you may need.\n\n\n## Prepare for gender affirm surgery\n\n1. Discuss the risks and options. Gender-affirming surgery is not right for everyone. It can be expensive and is irreversible. Your doctor and a therapist can help you decide if the benefits of getting gender affirming surgery outweigh the risks in your case. A therapist will determine if you're mentally healthy enough to undergo the procedure. They'll also consider how long you've wanted to get the procedure. Before you're approved, you'll have to show that you've been living as a woman for at least a year, including taking appropriate hormones.\n2. Obtain two letters of support from qualified mental health professionals. Each letter must be written by a mental health professional who is experienced in working with transgender individuals. You can search online for a qualified therapist near you using a site like Psychology Today. The letters should confirm the following:\n\t* Your gender identification is persistent and well-documented\n\t* You're competent to choose the surgery and consent to treatment\n\t* You're of legal age\n\t* You're being treated for any mental health conditions\n\t* You've been undergoing hormone treatment\n3. Plan to take extra time off work. It usually takes about 2 months to fully recover from gender-affirming surgery. At the very least, you'll need to stay home for the week after surgery. If you must go back after that week, however, it's best to arrange a lighter workload. If it's possible, ask your boss if you can have a flexible schedule or work from home. If you work a field job, ask for desk duty for a few weeks. You could also try working part-time. Check with your doctor before going back to work.\n4. Ask your doctor when you should stop taking your hormones. You'll need to stop taking your hormones before you can undergo the surgery. Each surgeon will make their own recommendation. In general, you can expect to stop taking them about 3 weeks before your surgery.\n5. Talk to your partner about sex post-surgery. After gender affirming surgery, it will likely take 2 months to fully recover. You will need to avoid sex during this time. You can still be intimate in other ways, and it's a good idea to explore those options before your surgery.\n6. Remove the hair from your genital area. Check with your surgeon to find out what this will entail. For some, it may just mean shaving your genital area. However, some surgeons require you to get electrolysis hair removal prior to getting gender-affirming surgery.\n7. Expect to be in the hospital for about 5-7 days. Your doctor will likely admit you to the hospital a day or 2 before your surgery. You'll then need to remain in the hospital after your surgery for at least 3 nights. However, the entire length of your stay can vary. It's a good idea to ask your doctor what the average hospital stay is for their patients. In the days after your surgery, you'll likely experience some pain and discomfort in your vagina. The doctor can help manage your pain as you heal.\n"}
{"prompt":"Did Hillary Clinton propose to punish flag burners in 2005?","response":"The proposed law co-sponsored by Clinton in 2005 prohibits flag burning under specific circumstances. It does not attempt to make flag burning illegal in general (i.e. outside of those specific circumstances). Clinton has voted against a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general.\n\nIn 2005, Clinton co-sponsored the Flag Protection Act of 2005, whose summary is as follows:\n\n> Flag Protection Act of 2005 - Amends the federal criminal code to revise provisions regarding desecration of the flag to prohibit: (1) destroying or damaging a U.S. flag with the primary purpose and intent to incite or produce imminent violence or a breach of the peace; (2) intentionally threatening or intimidating any person, or group of persons, by burning a U.S. flag; or (3) stealing or knowingly converting the use of a U.S. flag belonging to the United States, or belonging to another person on U.S. lands, and intentionally destroying or damaging that flag.\n\nIt seems like a reaction to ongoing efforts to pass a constitutional amendment allowing Congress to ban flag burning, a move that the co-sponsors of the 2005 act oppose and voted against. Its text notes:\n\n> the Bill of Rights is a guarantee of those freedoms and should not be amended in a manner that could be interpreted to restrict freedom, a course that is regularly resorted to by authoritarian governments which fear freedom and not by free and democratic nations\n\nbut suggests that flag burning with intent to incite violence is not protected by the Constitution (unlike flag burning as political expression, which is protected):\n\n> destruction of the flag of the United States can be intended to incite a violent response rather than make a political statement and such conduct is outside the protections afforded by the first amendment to the Constitution.\n\nNote that the distinction between \n\n* banning flag burning for being offensive, and \n* banning flag burning when it incites violence or disturbs the peace\n\nis an important one. The Flag Protection Act proposed in 2005 was essentially a replacement for a previous Flag Protection Act that banned flag burning in general:\n\n> Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, or tramples upon any flag of the United States shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\nbut this was deemed unconstitutional in United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 in 1990, on the basis of their earlier (1989) decision in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397. There, the Supreme Court noted that\n\n> an important governmental interest in regulating nonspeech can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms when speech and nonspeech elements are combined in the same course of conduct\n\nbut that in the case under consideration, this did not apply:\n\n> An interest in preventing breaches of the peace is not implicated on this record. \n\nand further noted that \n\n> Expression may not be prohibited [p398] on the basis that an audience that takes serious offense to the expression may disturb the peace, since the Government cannot assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but must look to the actual circumstances surrounding the expression.\n\nClinton was not one of the 59 co-sponsors of a proposed amendment to the constitution that would allow Congress to ban flag burning in general:\n\n> Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\nand she also voted against it. The proposed amendment failed to pass by one vote."}
{"prompt":"What is the English term for when someone thinks they are doing something nice for you but it ends up making things worse. EX: Someone buys you an elephant -- nice gesture and cool! But now you have to take care of it, and it becomes a burden on you.","response":"In fact, the English expression for a burdensome gift is literally white elephant:\n\n> a thing that is useless and no longer needed, although it may have cost a lot of money [OALD]\n\nSo-called white elephants, or albino elephants, are found in many parts of South and Southeast Asia. In Buddhist countries they may be venerated as Queen Maya, mother of the Buddha, was said to have been visited in a dream by a white elephant holding a white lotus flower, and Siddharth Gautama entered his mother's womb in the form a white elephant. The white elephant is also associated with traits like mental strength and purity.\nIt became a royal symbol in Siam (Thailand); the king continues to keep  white elephants. The story emerged that if a courtier displeased him, the king would make him a gift of a white elephant. The courtier could hardly decline a royal gift, and could hardly afford not to maintain a sacred animal, and could not put it to productive use, and so would be ruined by the cost of upkeep.\nThe earliest example of its use is from a 1721 essay in London Journal:\n\n  In short, Honour and Victory are generally no more than white Elephants; and for white Elephants the most destructive Wars have been often made.\n\nA 2011 paper by Ross Bullen entitled “This Alarming Generosity”: White Elephants and the Logic of the Gift, in American Literature, covers the popularization of the term in the mid-19th century, presents an alternative account, that the story is a piece of orientalism and the white elephant rose as a literary trope."}

Build up your emergency or rainy day fund. Make a fitness plan to improve your health.\n4. Overcome perfectionism. A huge source of pressure in life can be the desire to be perfect at everything. Have you ever been told that you have unrealistic standards at work? Do you ever feel you will never be able to live up to your own standards? If you answered yes to these questions, you may have difficulty with perfectionism. If so, try to loosen up your standards of achievement a little bit. This should help reduce your anxiety levels. If you feel disappointed with yourself, try repeating statements like \"nobody is perfect\" or \"I did my best\"\n\t* Try to think about your situation from a different angle. Ask yourself, will this situation still matter next month? If I told my brother or friend about this situation, would they think it matters as much as I do? Gain some perspective on your situation and maybe it won't seem quite as dire as it does right now.\n5. Create work-life boundaries so that you have time for yourself. Living in a digital age with constant access to screens - computers, tablets, smart phones - can make it difficult to escape the pressures of work. The pressure to be always online and accessible to colleagues can take a toll on work-life balance. To manage this kind of stress, it is helpful to create boundaries for yourself such as telling your colleagues you will be away from the phone or the computer at certain times of the day or on the weekend. Tell your colleagues you will be away from email and phone connectivity during dinner hours.\n6. Avoid comparing yourself to other people. If you're constantly trying to be someone you're not, you will feel stressed or burdened. Don't judge yourself based on how you think other people are living their life.Remind yourself that you have talents, skills, qualities, and good characteristics that are unique to you. Evaluate your goals and successes based on you want out of life, not what others want for you. Try to reduce how much time you spend on social media. People often post the best parts of their life on social media, so it may seem as though their lives are more perfect than they actually are.\n7. Give yourself some time away from work. If you are feeling burned out, it might be time for a personal day or even a vacation. Taking a vacation can actually help your productivity, and has obvious health benefits. If you don't have time for a vacation at the moment, try to at least take the weekend off to catch up on sleep. If you have vacation time or time off from work, take advantage of it. Those days are there for you to use them. A vacation might make you more productive.\n8. Set up an automatic 'out of office' reply on your email account. By setting up an automatic reply on weekends or when you are on vacation, you will not feel guilty for ignoring work emails. Also, your colleagues will be more likely to respect your away time. Include details on the days and times you are away in your 'out of office' automatic email reply. Include a fun or wise quote in your automatic reply so that colleagues will be reminded of your personality or sense of humour. This may reduce the annoyance of getting an automatic reply.\n\n\n## Take care of yourself\n\n1. Start a regular exercise routine. Exercise has been shown to reduce stress, improve feelings of well being and self esteem. Engaging in physical exercise leads to the production of the neurotransmitter endorphin, which is associated with improved sense of well being or what some people call runner's high. You don't need to be an athlete to experience this improved mood, and just 15 minutes a day can make a big difference..\n\t* After your exercise routine, try using a heat wrap around your neck and shoulders for 10 minutes to reduce tension in your upper body.\n2. Practice meditation. Find a comfortable place to sit in a quiet room or in a park. Observe the movement of your breath as it comes into your body and then flows out. Let go of passing thoughts. You can also do a walking meditation by walking slowly, preferably in a natural area, while watching your breath. Meditating for a few minutes a day can help reduce stress and anxiety. Deep, diaphragmatic breathing can reduce the heart rate and lower anxiety. [Image:Lessen the Pressure of Life Step 8.jpg|center]]\n\t* Meditate alongside your yoga practice and in your everyday life. Mindfulness-based stress reduction such as meditation and yoga are helpful in reducing stress and anxiety, including amongst college students.\n3. Eat whole plant foods as part of a healthy diet. Whole plant foods such as whole grains (e.g., brown rice), vegetables, and fruits are negatively associated with depression and anxiety. On the other hand, processed food (e.g., canned food) has been positively associated with stress and anxiety. Drink a cup of herbal tea.\n4. Ditch your second cup of coffee. Caffeine can exacerbate stress levels, so it is good to lower your caffeine intake as part of an overall stress reduction plan. Keep in mind that you may experience withdrawal symptoms, especially if you are a heavy coffee drinker.\n5. Cut down on sugar. Stress can make you crave sugary foods, but try to resist temptation. Giving in to these urges will not actually make you feel any better. Too much sugar can cause your blood sugar to crash, which can cause more stress and cravings.Sugary foods include most desserts, baked goods, soft drinks, juices, and candy.\n6. Reduce your consumption of alcohol. Although many turn to alcohol to deal with the everyday pressures of life, alcohol consumption can actually compound the impact of stress on the body and mind. Alcohol can also make your financial anxieties worse.\n\n\n## Gain perspective on life\n\n1. Talk to your friends and family about the sources of stress in your life and about everything you are grateful for. Face to face conversations with friends and family are especially important in helping reduce the pressures of life. Plan a movie night with close friends and pick a comedy! Laughing lowers cortisol which is the body's stress hormone. Go to a concert with friends. Listening to music can help reduce stress. So why not make a night of it and decompress with friends and music you love.\n2. Use positive thinking and self-talk to ward off stress. For instance, if you are experiencing a lot of stress at work due to an impending deadline, remember to tell yourself, “I can overcome this hurdle”\n3. Avoid trying to control everything in your life. Sometimes, there are surprises in life. You can't always predict or control what will happen. Letting go of the need to control everything can help you become happier and more at peace with the world.\n4. Express yourself through art therapy. Tapping into your creative side can help you work through the anxiety of everyday life. Using art therapy techniques, preferably alongside an art therapist, you can use drawing, painting, or music to express your inner feelings in more nuanced ways than may be possible with words alone. You don't have to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of creative self expression, including in relation to stress reduction.\n"}

{"prompt":"I am a big fan of worldbuilding. A common sight in science fiction is that aliens pretend to be human (For example in Third Rock from the Sun). Obviously if the aliens are advanced enough to disguise themselves as another species, there are much easier, simpler and less expensive methods to destroy humanity, so why else would an advanced alien civilization waste time, energy and resources to disguise themselves as humans? What possible scientific, cultural or commercial use could such an expensive procedure have?","response":"Aliens are alien, without a common background their motives may be incomprehensible.\nIf we assume that these aliens are Hollywood aliens (ie humans with odd-looking rubber bits stuck on their faces) then there are all of the reasons that humans from one culture spend time in another culture and try and learn to fit in:\n\n* Anthropology; studying how a different culture has developed to better understand the developmental processes that influenced your own.

{"prompt":"I've come across the polynomial algorithm that solves 2SAT. I've found it boggling that 2SAT is in P where all (or many others) of the SAT instances are NP-Complete. What makes this problem different? What makes it so easy (NL-Complete - even easier than P)?","response":"Here is a further intuitive and unpretentious explanation along the lines of MGwynne's answer.\nWith $2$-SAT, you can only express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b$, where $a$ and $b$ are literals. More precisely, every $2$-clause $l_1 \\lor l_2$ can be understood as a pair of implications: $\\lnot l_1 \\Rightarrow l_2$ and $\\lnot l_2 \\Rightarrow l_1$. If you set $a$ to true, $b$ must be true as well. If you set $b$ to false, $a$ must be false as well. Such implications are straightforward: there is no choice, you have only $1$ possibility, there is no room for case-multiplication. You can just follow every possible implication chain, and see if you ever derive both $\\lnot l$ from $l$ and $l$ from $\\lnot l$: if you do for some $l$, then the 2-SAT formula is unsatisfiable, otherwise it is satisfiable. It is the case that the number of possible implication chains is polynomially bounded in the size of the input formula.\nWith $3$-SAT, you can express implications of the form $a \\Rightarrow b \\lor c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are literals. Now you are in trouble: if you set $a$ to true, then either $b$ or $c$ must be true, but which one? You have to make a choice: you have 2 possibilities. Here is where case-multiplication becomes possible, and where the combinatorial explosion arises.\nIn other words, $3$-SAT is able to express the presence of more than one possibility, while $2$-SAT doesn't have such ability. It is precisely such presence of more than one possibility ($2$ possibilities in case of $3$-SAT, $k-1$ possibilities in case of $k$-SAT) that causes the typical combinatorial explosion of NP-complete problems.

{"prompt":"What's the difference between ASCII and Unicode?","response":"ASCII has 128 code points, 0 through 127.  It can fit in a single 8-bit byte, the values 128 through 255 tended to be used for other characters. With incompatible choices, causing the code page disaster.  Text encoded in one code page cannot be read correctly by a program that assumes or guessed at another code page.\n\nUnicode came about to solve this disaster. Version 1 started out with 65536 code points, commonly encoded in 16 bits. Later extended in version 2 to 1.1 million code points. The current version is 6.3, using 110,187 of the available 1.1 million code points. That doesn't fit in 16 bits anymore.\nEncoding in 16-bits was common when v2 came around, used by Microsoft and Apple operating systems for example. And language runtimes like Java. The v2 spec came up with a way to map those 1.1 million code points into 16-bits. An encoding called UTF-16, a variable length encoding where one code point can take either 2 or 4 bytes.  The original v1 code points take 2 bytes, added ones take 4.  \n\nAnother variable length encoding that's very common, used in *nix operating systems and tools is UTF-8, a code point can take between 1 and 4 bytes, the original ASCII codes take 1 byte the rest take more.  The only non-variable length encoding is UTF-32, takes 4 bytes for a code point. Not often used since it is pretty wasteful. There are other ones, like UTF-1 and UTF-7, widely ignored.\nAn issue with the UTF-16\/32 encodings is that the order of the bytes will depend on the endian-ness of the machine that created the text stream. So add to the mix UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.\n\nHaving these different encoding choices brings back the code page disaster to some degree, along with heated debates among programmers which UTF choice is \"best\". Their association with operating system defaults pretty much draws the lines. One counter-measure is the definition of a BOM, the Byte Order Mark, a special codepoint (U+FEFF, zero width space) at the beginning of a text stream that indicates how the rest of the stream is encoded. It indicates both the UTF encoding and the endianess and is neutral to a text rendering engine. Unfortunately it is optional and many programmers claim their right to omit it so accidents are still pretty common."}
{"prompt":"How to be creative when playing with your barbies?","response":"There are endless fun possibilities when it comes to playing with Barbies. If you need ideas for activities, consider doing things like creating a beach for Barbie, pretending she's a doctor to help sick patients, or hosting a fashion show to show off all of her clothing. You can also create things for Barbie, such as furniture to go in her house or new clothing for her to wear.\n\n## Do activities with barbie\n\n1. Create your own Barbie mansion to play house with Barbie. If you bought a playhouse just for Barbie, great! If not, empty a bookshelf or stack empty boxes on top of one another on their sides to create your own. You can fill it with furniture and have Barbie decorate her home, use her kitchen, lounge in her bedroom, or chat with friends in her living room. Have Barbie throw a dinner party in her home, inviting other dolls and eating great food. Barbie could host a sleepover at her house and watch a funny movie.\n2. Turn Barbie into a doctor to have her help patients. Pretend that Barbie is a doctor or nurse and create an office for her to see sick patients. Use other dolls or toys to be the sick patients, and have Barbie check their throat, ears, nose, temperature, and breathing to see if she can help them get better. Pretend Barbie is a surgeon and is operating on another doll to save its life, or have Barbie fix up another doll’s broken arm or ankle.\n3. Take Barbie to the beach by playing in a sandy spot. Use an outdoor sandbox, sandy section of your yard, or build your own beach by pouring sand into a plastic tub indoors. Let Barbie relax on a towel under a beach umbrella in the sand while she reads a book or talks to a friend. Use a piece of fabric or a washcloth as Barbie’s beach towel. Put Barbie in her bathing suit so she can soak up some sun. Create a beach umbrella using a decorative drink umbrella, or by cutting an umbrella shape out of paper and sticking a toothpick or pencil through the middle. Add a small tub of water next to the sand to create an “ocean.”\n4. Send Barbie to the hair salon to fix up her hair. To smooth out any tangles in Barbie’s hair, dip her hair in a mixture of fabric softener and water and then use a brush to brush out the tangles. Curl Barbie’s hair using pipe cleaners and hot water, or dye her hair with food coloring mixed with water. To curl Barbie’s hair, take small sections of her hair and roll each section up on a small piece of pipe cleaner, just as you would real hair curlers. Dip her hair in hot water and let it dry. Mix a drop or 2 of food coloring in a bowl of water before dipping Barbie’s hair into the colored water. This works best if Barbie has blonde hair.\n5. Let Barbie be a teacher to teach other dolls new things. Set up a school room with rows of chairs and desks for the doll students to sit and learn, and have Barbie write lessons on a chalkboard to teach everyone things like math, science, or foreign languages. You can even create small books for everyone to read and learn from! Barbie doesn’t just have to be a school teacher - have her teach other dolls how to ride a horse, how to make a cake, or how to swim. Tape a piece of paper up on the wall to use as the chalkboard. Make books by cutting paper into sections that are roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) wide and 2 in (5.1 cm) long. Fold these sections in half and add a staple right on the folded line.\n6. Have Barbie star in her own movie using a video camera or phone. This could be an action movie where Barbie is involved in a high-speed car chase, a romantic movie where Barbie falls in love with someone, or any other genre that you like. Use a phone or video camera to film each scene so you can watch it later on. Plan out each scene before filming, such as which props you’ll need and what Barbie will say. Ask friends or family members to help you shoot the movie so that you can have more characters in it. For example, you could film the movie outside and pretend that Barbie is stuck on an island and needs to be rescued.\n7. Take Barbie on a road trip if she has her own car. Pack up Barbie’s car with snacks, clothing, and any other gear she’ll need for a road trip, or use your imagination and use a cardboard box as her car. Have Barbie travel from room to room, meeting new people and trying new things. Barbie could also travel by plane, bus, boat, bicycle, or train. For example, you could pretend that each room in your house is a different country, and Barbie takes a plane to France, Greece, and Japan to try out their food. Take Barbie on a road trip to go shopping, hear music, or experience a festival.\n8. Create a pool for Barbie using a sink or plastic container. Fill a bowl or plastic container with water and dress Barbie up in her swimsuit so that she can go swimming. Make sure Barbie is able to get wet before dipping her in the water, especially if she has a special hairdo. Have Barbie throw a pool party and invite her friends. Play music, have Barbie sit on a pool towel next to the pool, or let her practice doing fun dives into the water.\n9. Put on a fashion show using Barbie’s clothing. Dress Barbie in fancy dresses, businesswoman attire, lounge wear, or in crazy costumes. Use the clothing you already have for Barbie, or create new clothing using materials around your house such as balloons, pieces of fabric, or old socks. Play music while putting on the fashion show so that Barbie can strut down the runway. For example, dress Barbie up like a princess, astronaut, ballerina, basketball player, or celebrity.\n\n\n## Make clothe and furniture for barbie\n\n1. Cut up balloons to make clothing for Barbie. Cut both ends of the balloon off using scissors to create a skirt or strapless dress, or design more detailed shirts and dresses by cutting arm holes into the balloon. Slide the balloon up over Barbie’s body starting at her feet once you’re done. The balloon should be deflated to use it as clothing.\n2. Create a dress out of a piece of fabric. Look around the house to find spare pieces of fabric used for sewing or projects. To make a super simple dress, cut a circle out of the fabric with a diameter of about 1 foot (30 cm). Cut a small hole for Barbie’s head right in the middle, and then 2 arm holes on either side. Slide the dress over Barbie’s head and use a ribbon or piece of string to tie it at the waist. Make sure the main hole in Barbie’s dress is big enough for her head to fit through. Design more complicated pieces of clothing, such as pants or long-sleeve shirts, if desired.\n3. Cover sponges in fabric to create a comfy couch. Find pieces of fabric for sewing or crafts around the house and cut them into squares large enough to fit over the sponge, leaving 1 in (2.5 cm) of extra fabric on each side. You can either sew the fabric to create a cover for the sponge, or you can glue the fabric onto the sponge. Do this with at least 2 sponges and then place one flat on the ground with the other up against a wall as a backrest. For a super comfy couch, make the seat of the couch out of 2 sponges stacked on top of one another. To create a long sectional, use 4-6 sponges to form the couch.\n4. Stack empty matchboxes on top of one another to form drawers. You can color, paint, or cover the outside of the matchboxes with paper beforehand, if desired. Place the matchboxes on top of one another, adding drops of glue in between each layer to keep them all in place. Place Barbie’s things, such as her hairbrush, phone, mirror, or books, in the drawers. If you only have one matchbox, prop the matchbox up on something like a piece of cardboard or paper clips and turn it into a one-drawer nightstand. Cover the new drawers with stickers, glitter, or pictures.\n5. Turn a shoebox into a bed for Barbie. Find an old shoebox from your closet, garage, or other storage spot and empty it out. Place a washcloth or small blanket inside, as well as something that will be used as a pillow. Now Barbie has a bed ready for sleeping! Create a pillow by stuffing a piece of fabric or a cloth bag with tissues or stuffing. Decorate the sides of the bed using markers, pencils, or paint.\n6. Tie ribbon onto a small hair band to make a tutu for Barbie. Find an extra hair tie and ribbon that you like. Cut the ribbon into 6 in (15 cm) sections, and then tie the ribbon onto the hair tie so that the middle of the ribbon is where the knot is. Do this all the way around the hair tie to create a fun tutu. Use different colored or patterned ribbon to make the tutu super colorful. If your hair tie is too big and won’t fit Barbie, find a rubber band and cut it before tying a new knot to make it the perfect size.\n7. Design chairs using cardboard and paper clips. Use scissors to cut cardboard into strips that are at least 3 in (7.6 cm) wide. By bending these strips of cardboard, you can create simple chairs or chaise lounges. If you want the chair to stand up off the ground, bend paper clips to form chair ends and use glue or tape to attach them to the bottom of the chairs. Fold a 6 in (15 cm) long piece of cardboard in half to create a simple chair. Fold a 9 in (23 cm) long piece of cardboard into thirds to form a chaise lounge.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to call the united arab emirates?","response":"The United Arab Emirates, or UAE, is a vibrant nation and tourist destination. Whether you have family and friends there or need to contact a business, you may need to call internationally. Dialing a number in the UAE is simple when you dial the correct exit, country, and area codes. Before you place your call, read about time zone differences and different calling options allowed by the UAE government to save yourself money.\n\n## Dial a uae number\n\n1. Dial your country’s exit code to route the call internationally. Each country has its own exit code, so the number you need to dial varies slightly depending on where you are in the world. The most common exit codes are 00, used throughout Europe, and 011, used for most of North America. Ask your phone service provider for the access code or look it up at https:\/\/www.howtocallabroad.com\/codes.html\n\t* For example, the exit code for Australia is 0011. When you dial the UAE, the phone number looks like 0011+XXX+X+XXX-XXXX. Some countries have multiple exit codes. In Brazil, for example, each phone service provider has its own exit code. If you’re calling from a cell phone, look for a + button on your number pad. Pressing it automatically inputs the exit code. You don’t need to type it in yourself afterward.\n2. Type in 971 to reach the United Arab Emirates. Every country in the world has a unique country code. You will always reach a UAE number by dialing 971. In addition, the country code always comes after your exit code. Make sure you type the correct country code. If you get the code wrong, you may end up calling someone in a different country! After typing the country code, the number you have dialed may look something like 0011+971+X+XXX-XXXX.\n3. Include the area code for the city you wish to call in the UAE. Like in a lot of countries, the UAE is divided up into service regions. Major UAE cities like Dubai are covered by single-digit area codes. For smaller regions like Tarif, the area code is 2 digits long. Find an area code at https:\/\/countrycode.org\/uae. For example, the area code for Dubai is 4. Dial 2 to reach Abu Dhabi instead. The area code always comes after the country code, so the number you have dialed will look like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXXX. If you see a phone number that begins with 0, leave off the 0 when dialing it. For example, you may see a Dubai number with a 04 area code. The 0 is for domestic calls, so dial it only when you're calling from within the UAE.\n4. Use an area code starting with 5 if you’re calling a mobile number. Mobile numbers have a separate area code no matter where you’re calling. The code you need depends on what service provider the other person has. The only way to figure out someone’s mobile phone number is by asking them or figuring out which service provider they use. Mobile codes are always 2 digits long. For example, numbers covered by Etisalat use 50 or 54. Numbers covered by Du often begin with 52 or 55. If you’re calling a mobile number, dial something like 0011+971+55+XXX-XXXX. Like with landlines, avoid dialing 0 if a phone number starts with it. You only need to dial it when you’re calling domestically.\n5. Type in the phone number to complete the call. Phone numbers in the UAE are 7 digits long, excluding the area code. To complete the call, you will need to ask for that phone number or find it online. The finished phone number will look something like 0011+971+4+XXX-XXX. This number places a call to Dubai from Australia.\n\n\n## Manage fee while call\n\n1. Contact your phone carrier to get a calling plan if you make lots of calls. Notify your phone service provider that you plan on calling the UAE. Ask them about the costs and what plans they have available. Many carriers have monthly plans catering to international callers. If you think you’ll need to make lots of calls, such as when contacting family in the UAE, a prepaid plan can save you a lot of money. Note any fees the phone carrier includes in their terms of service. Calling abroad is often costly, so explore your options before settling on a carrier.\n2. Get a prepaid calling plan if you make few calls. A lot of the major phone carriers offer pay as you go plans. You decide in advance how many minutes you wish to buy. When your minutes are up, you can no longer make calls until you buy more data. Prepaid plans are a great way to place international calls without paying for a monthly plan. Your phone calls are limited to what you pay for, so you do need to manage time wisely. However, using limited data prevents you from overspending on long calls.\n3. Buy calling cards for reduced rates if you make short calls. Order an international calling card online or buy one from a telephone service provider. Read the front of the card to find out how many minutes it contains and what rate it charges. Make sure the card is valid for calls to the United Arab Emirates. When you use the card, dial the number on it before dialing your country’s exit code. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find cards available at supermarkets, convenience stores, and other locations. If you visit the UAE, the country’s telecom companies sell prepaid cards that stay valid even while you’re abroad. Read the fine print on the cards carefully to find out what fees come along with placing calls.\n4. Purchase a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) phone for frequent calls. Find a service provider that sells VoIP phone plans, such as Vonage. Phones equipped with VoIP technology place calls over the Internet instead of traditional phone lines. As a result, you can place international calls at a reduced rate. If you call the UAE several times a month, VoIP technology is a good investment. Some companies sell phone adapters that allow you to place VoIP calls on your regular phone. Use the adapter to place calls through your computer or landline. The disadvantage of VoIP phones is that you need a stable Internet connection. Using a high-speed connection increases the quality of your calls.\n5. Use a legal Internet app if you wish to make quality video calls. In the UAE, the government sets regulations on what apps its citizens can use for phone calls. Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) apps are common across the world, and the ones used in the UAE are called Botim and C’me. To use these apps, you need to either be connected to Wi-Fi or use your phone’s mobile network. The person you are calling also needs to have the app installed on their device. Botim and C’me charge a monthly fee to access the app, which can get costly for most residents. On the plus side, these apps offer both regular and video calls. As of 2018, apps like Skype and FaceTime are banned in the UAE. This may change in the near future, but for now, the UAE government wants to steer its citizens away from free services.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to look up a bible verse?","response":"People quote the Bible in a variety of contexts. If you want to be able to look those quotes up, you’ll need to understand the way the Bible is organized. It’s also possible to look up quotes without knowing their location. Simply knowing a couple of words from a verse can be enough to help you locate it if you know how.\n\n## Look up a verse by number\n\n1. Identify the book of the verse. When Bible verses are listed, the first thing you’ll see is the name of a book. Use the table of contents in your Bible to locate that book within it. The table of contents is at the beginning of the Bible. Locate the name in the table of contents and turn to the page associated with the start of the book. The name of the book might be abbreviated or spelled out completely. Some books include:\n\t* Exodus (Ex)\n\t* Genesis (Gen)\n\t* Numbers (Num)\n2. Identify the chapter. After the book name, you’ll see two numbers. The first number is the chapter. For example, in “John 3:16”, “3” is the chapter number. Look at the verse and determine which chapter it is from in the book. Some people may cite Bible verse using abbreviations and Roman numerals. For example, Lev. xx:13 is the same as Leviticus, chapter 20, verse 13. Locate that chapter within the book. You may be able to find the location of that chapter in the table of contents. If not, you can thumb through the specific book until you see that chapter. As with other books, it should clearly say, “Chapter \\_\\_” at the beginning of each chapter. In addition, many versions clearly say,  : at the top of each page indicating the first verse on that page. Some also note the last verse on the page.\n3. Identify the verse number. The second number after the book name is the verse number. This number should come after a colon (:). In the case of John 3:16, 16 would be the verse number. If you're looking up a longer passage, there may be two numbers, separated by a hyphen (-). For example, in John 3:16-18, you're looking for verses 16,17, and 18.\n4. Locate the verse within the chapter. Once you’ve found the chapter, go through it until you find the verse. The verses go in numerical order, just like chapters. There should be a small number at the beginning of each sentence or a small group of sentences. This is the verse number. If you're looking for multiple verses, such as John 3:16-18, 17 and 18 would follow directly after 16.\n\n\n## Look up a verse with a concordance\n\n1. Choose a concordance. A concordance is a book that lists every instance of a word’s appearance in the Bible. This is a great tool if you remember the verse, or part of the verse, but you don’t know which book or chapter it came from. Concordances can be found through religious retailers or online. Your church may also have one that you can borrow.\n2. Search for a word from the verse. Remember an important word from the verse. Look it up in the concordance the same way that you would look it up in a dictionary. Concordances are alphabetized. Choose a distinctive word that may have limited occurrences, such as “flood,” “mountain,” or “rubies.” If you choose something like “love” or “evil” you’re likely to find an enormous number of results.\n3. Search for other words if necessary. If you find too many results, or you don’t see the verse you’re looking for, try searching for another word. For example, if you remember the phrase, “love must be sincere” and you searched “love” but found too many results, try looking up, “sincere.”\n4. Locate the verse from the concordance list. The concordance will list all of the places where that word is found in the Bible. A complete concordance will give you some context so that you can be sure it’s the verse you’re looking for. Use the location that the concordance gives you (for example, Romans 12:9) to look up the complete verse and its context in your bible.\n5. Try another translation if necessary. Concordances are specific to translations. If you can’t find the verse you’re looking for, try a concordance for a different translation. For example, if your Bible translated a word to the English word “praise,\" but your concordance is for a Bible that translated that word as “worship,” it will be impossible to look up the verse.\n\n\n## Look up a verse online\n\n1. Search the verse number online. Choose a search engine, or go to a website dedicated to Bible study. Type the name of the book and the chapter and verse numbers into the search engine. Type the verse number in the generally accepted format if you can. For example, you'll get more accurate results if you type, \"John 3:16,\" than, \"Chapter 3 16 John.\"\n2. Remember what you can about the verse. Do you remember a certain phrase of the verse? Maybe you remember one or two words and the name of the book it came from. Even if you can’t remember very much, you can likely still look up the verse.\n3. Enter what you know into a search engine. Type in everything you can remember. You should also include the words “Bible” and “verse” to make sure that you get results that are relevant to your search. Your search terms may be something like, “Bible verse about wives in Psalms,” or “Bible verse chapter 7 desert.”\n4. Use a site designed for Bible searches. There are plenty of sites online that catalog Bible verses by subject or by book. You can use one of these websites to search for the verse. Type in a keyword or a subject. You may also be able to do an advanced search by book or chapter. These online tools can be great ways to find other verses that may be relevant to you or helpful in your studies or prayers.\n5. Search related words. If you can’t remember any exact words from the verse, or your search is not going well, search related words. For example, if you searched for “stars” and didn’t find anything, you could search for “night” or “sky” or “heavens” to see if the verse shows up. It’s possible you’re using a different translation or that you misremembered details about the verse.\n"}

{"prompt":"Write a Wikipedia page about the Prague Uprising of 1848.","response":"The Prague Uprising of 1848 (Czech: Pražské červnové povstání), also known as the Pentecostal Storm, was an armed conflict on 12-17 June 1848 in Prague, which culminated in the revolutionary process in the Czech lands. The uprising was a spontaneous unprepared uprising, which was suppressed by the army and killed about 43 people.\n\n##Background\nFrom March 11, 1848 (Assembly in Svatováclavské lázně) there was a political unrest in Prague, by which Prague joined the wider revolutionary current in the whole of Europe. At that time, Czech politics had already split into a liberal current (František Palacký, Karel Havlíček Borovský) and a radically democratic one (Karel Sabina, Josef Václav Frič, Vincenc Vávra Haštalský, Vilém Gauč, Emanuel Arnold). In the first phase, the moderate liberals prevailed. They preferred constructive and cautious steps, such as the establishment of the St. Wenceslas Committee on March 12. On 19 and 31 March, the Committee prepared two petitions to the Emperor, which mainly included the requirements of linguistic equality, the establishment of the National Newspaper (April 5), the transformation of the St. Wenceslas Committee into the National Committee (April 10), Palacký's Writing in Frankfurt (April 11), founding of the Lípa slovanská association (April 30), organization of the Slavic Congress (June 2-12). Meanwhile, the radical wing also strengthened. On June 1, its press body, the Prague Evening Paper, began publishing. It was then supported by the arrival of some delegates to the Slavic Congress (especially Mikhail Bakunin).\n\nAt the beginning of June, the commanding general in Bohemia, Alfred Windischgrätz, decided that the growing tensions would be dampened by military demonstrations of force - military patrols were constantly passing through the city, artillery batteries were deployed on Petrin and Vysehrad, a massive military parade was held on June 7, with military reinforcements from Kutná Hora and Hradec Králové. This then increased tensions in the city.\n\nOn June 11, Prague students met in Karolinum and sent a deputation to Windischgrätz, demanding that the army ease the situation. They were rejected, after which the students issued them as a leaflet and hung them around Prague (the so-called Red Poster). On the evening of June 11, an assembly met at the St. Wenceslas Spa [cs] in Zderaz [cs] to discuss the situation. It decided to hold a mass demonstration (so-called \"fraternal mass\") on the second day at the Horse Market (today's Wenceslas Square).\n\n##Uprising\nThe Mass was attended by the patriotic retired priest Jan Arnold (1785–1872), the brother of the radical democrat Emanuel Arnold. After the Mass, the participants did not disperse and marched through the city in a procession. Around noon, they were stopped by the army in Celetná Street. This ignited a spark of rebellion led by students and radical Democrats (the Liberals stayed away and sought a compromise with Windischgrätz). Many barricades were erected in Prague, where the 12th – 14th century was fought. On the very first day of the uprising, June 12, a stray bullet probably killed Prince Windischgrätz's wife as she stood at a window watching street fights. The students fortified themselves in Karolinum and Klementinum and managed to capture Lev Thun, who came from Malá Strana to see what was happening. The next day, Thun refused to mediate negotiations with the students with Windischgrätz. Thun was eventually released at the urging of Palacký, Šafárik and Borovský.\n\nOn the night of June 14-15, Windischgrätz changed tactics, the army withdrew to the left bank of the Vltava and from there began shelling the Old Town, where there were the most barricades, from artillery, to avoid fighting in the streets of Prague. News of the uprising in Prague was well received in the Czech countryside. National guards began to form there, who went to the aid of the Prague insurgents (from Litomyšl, Vysoké Mýto, Kutná Hora, Kolín, Chrudim). They could no longer influence the course of the fighting. On June 17, the insurgents capitulated. About 43 people died during the fighting.\n\nOn June 18, a state of siege was declared throughout Prague and rioters began to be arrested. On June 26, the National Committee was dissolved due to the participation of some of its members in the June uprising. On July 20, the siege was lifted and the situation in the Czech lands calmed down. The revolution then took place mainly in Vienna.\n\n##Aftermath\nDuring the uprising, 43 insurgents were killed and 63 were injured. A total of 14 dead and 71 wounded were in Windischgrätz's army.\n\nBy suppressing the Pentecostal storm in Prague, the Austrian conservative power tested that a military solution to the political situation was possible, and it was Windischgrätz who was called to Vienna for this task.\n\nAfter suppressing the uprising, the Liberals focused on enforcing changes in the constituent assemblies (first in Vienna, then in Kroměříž), the radical Democrats attempted a second offensive in 1849 (control of the Lípa slovanská association, preparation of a May Conspiracy in cooperation with Mikhail Bakunin), but on May 10, they were arrested, a state of siege was declared in Prague, and thus the resistance was definitively broken."}
{"prompt":"What does strength refer to in mathematics? Is it a formal idea?","response":"Suppose you have a theorem that says \"If $X$, then $Y$.\"  There are two ways to strengthen such a theorem:\n\n* Assume less.  If you can reduce the number of hypotheses, but still prove the same conclusion, then you have proved a more \"powerful\" result (in the sense that it applies in more situations).\n* Prove more.  If you can keep the same hypotheses, but add more information to the conclusion, then you have also produced a more \"powerful\" result.\n\nHere is an easy example from Geometry.\n\n  Let $ABCD$ be a (non-square) rectangle.  Then the internal angle bisectors of the vertices intersect at four points $WXYZ$, which are the vertices of a rectangle.\n\n(You need the condition that $ABCD$ is not a square because if it is a square then all four angle bisectors coincide at a single point.)\nHere are a few ways to strengthen the theorem:\n\n* The hypothesis \"$ABCD$ is a (non-square) rectangle\" can be relaxed to the more general \"$ABCD$ is a (non-rhombic) parallelogram\".

{"prompt":"How to peel plums?","response":"Peeled plums are perfect for pies, jam, cakes, and baby food. If you try to peel a plum by simply pulling back the skin, you'll end up with a sticky mess on your hands. Instead, blanch the plums and then place them in an ice bath or trim the skin off with a knife. This simple techniques are quick, easy, and will leave you with delicious plum flesh.\n\n## Blanch plums\n\n1. Boil a pot of water on the stovetop. Choose a pot large enough to hold all your plums and fill half of it with water. It'll probably take about 10 minutes to boil..\n\t* Place a lid on the pot to help the water to boil quicker.\n2. Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Add water and ice to the bowl at a 50:50 ratio. This will act as an ice bath for the plums.\n3. Slice an \"x\" on the bottom of each plum. Use a paring knife to cut a cross hatch at the bottom of the plum (the side opposite the stem). Make each cut to be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. This will make it nice and easy to peel back the skin. Don’t worry about making the cut deep, simply cut through the skin of the plum.\n4. Blanch the plums for 45 seconds in boiling water. Carefully place the plums into the pot of water. It is important not to leave the plums in the water for longer than 45 seconds, as the flesh will go mushy and the plums will start to disintegrate. Always be careful when cooking with hot water to avoid burns.\n5. Submerge the plums in the ice water for 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the plums from the boiling water into the ice bath. The icy water will help to pull the skin away from the flesh of the plums. Make sure that all the plums are fully submerged in the water. If some of the plums aren’t submerged in the ice bath, make another ice bath for them.\n6. Peel the skin off the plums. Place your finger under 1 of the little flaps formed by the \"x\" you sliced, and pull back the flap. The skin should easily come loose in 1 big strip. Keep pulling back the flaps on all four sides until you've completely peeled the plum. If there is still a little skin on the plum, use a paring knife to slice off any remaining skin.\n7. Cut around the circumference of the plum. Press the paring knife firmly into the flesh until it hits the stone. Follow the natural seam in the skin and cut right around the plum. Keeping cutting until you have split the plum in half.If you don’t have a paring knife, use a sharp kitchen knife instead.\n8. Twist each half of the plum in opposite directions to pull it away from the stone. Hold 1 half of the plum in each hand. Firmly grip the halves and slowly turn them away from each other until one half of the plum comes loose from the stone.\n9. Lever the stone out with a spoon. Push a dessert spoon under the stone and then press the handle down to pop the stone out. If the stone won’t coming out, push the spoon under the opposite side of the stone and then lever it out.\n\n\n## Use a knife\n\n1. Cut the plum in half and pop the stone out. Place the plum on a chopping board and cut around the circumference of the plum. Use a teaspoon to pop the stone out of the plum.\n2. Chop both pieces of plum in half. Cut each plum half lengthways to create a wedge. This makes the plum easier to peel.If your plum is particularly large, consider chopping each piece of plum into thirds.\n3. Trim the skin off each plum wedge. Press the skin side of the plum firmly down against the chopping board. Carefully glide the knife as close to the skin as possible to remove the skin from the flesh.Compost the plum skin or use it in smoothies.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do the different groups\/sects of Buddhism view attaining enlightenment and living a common life? In other words, do they think it is possible to be a common person and achieve enlightenment? Even for someone who has a family, friends and coworkers that aren't Buddhists?","response":"Whether you have to follow a monastic lifestyle to attain enlightenment depends. At first approximation, the answer is: yes in Theravada, no in Mahayana. Since probably as early as Milindapanha (~100 BCE) and most certainly by the time of Visuddhimagga (~430CE), the orthodox (~Theravada) position was, you must be a monk to attain Nirvana.\n\nRegarding Enlightenment, I should point out that Enlightenment is the goal of Mahayana, while in Theravada, the final goal is usually called Nirvana (Nibbana in Pali), not Enlightenment (Bodhi in Pali). In Mahayana, Enlightenment can be attained by a layperson.\n\nThese are \"official\" positions (as much as we can talk about official positions in such a heterogeneous conglomerate of teachings as Buddhism). Informally, what some Mahayana schools call \"Enlightenment\" is what Theravada schools call mere \"stream-entry\". Other Mahayana schools however have this notion of multiple levels (bhumi), in which what Theravada calls \"stream-entry\" is level 1 of 10, with Final Enlightenment counted as 11th. It gets complicated from \"stream-entry\" onward, because the boundaries of \"self\" no longer apply, thus it is difficult to talk about Enlightenment with no subject to tie it to.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, it is extremely difficult to make any meaningful progress towards Enlightenment\/Nirvana if most of the focus is on pursuing material ends (success, wealth, entertainment, helping your relatives achieve the same, etc). In order to get pretty close to X while leading a semi-normal life, one's top priority must be spiritual practice, followed by family and everything else. This basically means, squeezing study of Buddhist philosophy here and there, making meditation part of your daily routine, and, most importantly, deliberately utilizing your family & work situations as a shooting range for Dharma practice."}

{"prompt":"How to construct a 90 degrees angle using compass and ruler?","response":"Often you are required to construct some angles without using a protractor. The following answer teaches you how to draw a 90 degrees angle using a compass and a ruler.\n\n## At the end of a line segment\n\n1. Mark the vertex of your angle anywhere on the paper. Let us name this point as M.\n2. Draw a ray MN, extending in any direction and of any length. This will be one of the arms of our angle.\n3. Place tip of the compass on point M and draw a circle cutting the ray MN at some point (say P).\n4. Keep the width of the compass the same. Then place its tip on P and draw an arc cutting the circle at some point (say Q).\n5. Keep the width of the compass the same. Place its tip on Q and draw another arc cutting the circle at another point (say R).\n6. Keep the tip of the compass still on Q. Draw another arc somewhere outside the circle. For carrying out this step, you can set the width of the compass to any measure.\n7. Keep the same width of the compass (as set in the previous step). Now place its tip on R and draw another arc which cuts the arc drawn in the previous step at some point (say S).\n8. Connect the points M and S with a straight line. Extend it to form a ray ML. The measure of the angle LMN is 90.\n\n\n## Through the middle of a line segment\n\n1. Draw a straight line. On a piece of paper, draw a line segment of any convenient length. Make it horizontal for the sake of simplicity, but it could be at any angle. Label the line segment AB.\n2. Pick any point on AB. Mark it, and label it O. O can be anywhere on the line segment, including at either end point (A or B). For convenience, let's put O somewhere near the middle of AB. The line segment could now be referred to as AOB.\n3. Grab a compass. Open the compass to a radius a little shorter than either AO or OB. Now place the compass point at O. Strike short arcs through AB on either side of O. The two arcs should have the same radius. Label those two points of intersection C and D. Now the line segment could be referred to as ACODB.\n4. Strike two more arcs. Place the compass point at C, and strike an arc to one side of the line segment. Then place the compass point at D, and strike a second arc of the same radius and on the same side of the line segment. Make sure those two arcs intersect. Call that point of intersection E.\n5. Draw the 90° angle. Draw a straight line from E to O. Line segment EO forms a 90° angle with line segment AB. It actually forms two 90° angles at O. If you were to extend EO beyond AB, you would form four 90° angles at O.Note that you can draw a 90° angle at either end of line segment AB if you want to (in other words at point A or point B). Simply extend AB beyond A or beyond B, and then follow the above steps. Point A (or point B) would serve as point O in the above instructions. This is essentially the same method featured in How to Construct a Perpendicular Line to a Given Line Through Point on the Line, Method 2.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to play sonic unleashed for xbox 360?","response":"Some people may find Sonic Unleashed on the Xbox 360 hard. But it's pretty easy with practice. Some may find it hard to press several buttons quickly.\n\n## Controller basics\n\n1. When you're holding the controller, put your index & middle finger on the trigger and bumper buttons (so you'll be ready to drift when needed) and put your left thumb on the right analog stick and left thumb on the A,X,Y and B buttons.\n2. The left control stick is used to move Sonic; the A button is used for jumping ; the B button is used to boost; the X button is used to stomp or crouch; the Y button is used for the light speed dash; the trigger buttons are used for drifting; and the bumper buttons are used for side stepping left and right.\n3. Many new skills and upgrades can be obtained through certain conditions, progressing through the game, or by buying them with yellow diamonds you get from enemies.\n\n\n## Boost guidelines\n\n1. To reach the highest speeds, drift in a straight line (this is not something you need to do, but it does speed you along and again it's more of an expert technique).\n2. When you're on a slope going upwards, when near you're near top of it, jump and it will give you maximum height and to boost over some areas.\n3. Try boosting then jumping right after then boosting again in the air to boost over a whole area.\n\n\n## Attack techniques\n\n1. The main method of defeating enemies is the homing attack. Try to use this also for combo attacks for bonus points and getting to places beyond Sonic's reach or to correct any missed\/wrongly timed jumps.\n2. Stomping is another way of attacking enemies and is used best when attacking from above or when a homing attack doesn't work or isn't as effective.\n3. Ironically enough, you can actually use the speed boost and drift to take down groups of enemies at high speeds that you normally can't take down or would take longer with conventional attack moves.\n\n\n## 2d platforming\n\n1. 2D sections are more platform based and as a result are much harder and take longer to do. Remember to not be as reckless when going through these sections; do not use the speed boost unless Sonic is running in a harmless path.\n2. Properly time your homing attacks, crouches, light speed dashes, and wall jumps by being as fast as possible, pressing the button combos well, and by following the on-screen button prompt as it's needed in order to succeed through 2D platforming.\n3. Take alternate routes with cannons, grind rails, zip-lines, and other mechanisms to skip large portions of the 2D sections with little to no risk.\n\n\n## Trick\n\n1. There are many tricks and techniques that aren't mentioned in the game or is difficult to pull off. One should master them to beat the levels more easily and have a better time, which includes the aerial boost, parkour, sky diving, and drifting.\n2. Aerial boosting is simply pressing a set of buttons that appear on-screen when Sonic files into the air and everything becomes slow; successfully pressing these buttons within a short time allows Sonic to go over gaps and reach out of reach places.\n3. Parkour tricks such as running on walls and wall-jumping (in 3D areas) can be utilized by speed boosting on walls and pressing the button that appears on-screen when Sonic attempts to wall-jump on certain walls.\n4. Sky diving is simply diving really fast while in the air after Sonic is free falling to an area below; pressing the X button will increase your speed while titling the control stick controls your position which can help avoid obstacles and reach the ground faster.\n5. Drifting is turning around sharp corners without losing speed; this is difficult to maneuver as Sonic's natural speed interferes with his handling - simply tilt the control stick left and right (slightly) to make drifting easier to do.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to find accounting telecommuting jobs?","response":"## Account telecommuting tip\n\n1. Work in an office setting for a few years before starting to work from a home office. These years are not only valuable for experience, but they also allow you to build up a client base.\n2. Become part of a local professional network or volunteer organization. When you work from home, it is even more important to network with people in the business community. As a telecommuter, you will rely on contacts and referrals.\n3. Invest in organization and technology in your home office. Having fewer employees means that you will have to ensure your system is impeccably organized, automated and secure. Your ability to stay on top of projects is likely to have an effect on future jobs from repeat business. Other technology that you may want to look into is routing office calls to your cell phone, an Internet fax service, an online receipt scanner, like Shoe boxed, and video conferencing.\n4. Create a website for your business. You will need to invest in marketing in order to make your business appear legitimate to prospective clients, and get your name into the public. Keep the following information in mind when developing your website. Post reviews from current and former clients. This can help show potential clients the diverse types of accounting you can do. Advertise the advantages of using a home-based accountant. In general, home-based accountants charge approximately 70 percent less because they have less overhead. You may also be able to offer more flexible meeting times than office-based accountants and more personal attention. Link your website to your LinkedIn profile or a resume, so that clients can see what experience you have in the field and your certifications. Add on website plugins like an appointment scheduler and a contact form.\n\n\n## Find telecommuting job\n\n1. Ask your former or current clients for referrals. Although your clients may stay with an accounting firm if you leave it, the best way to look for jobs is to give out business cards and inquire with business professionals and former clients if they would give your name to anyone in need of accounting services.\n2. Reach out to your friends, family and contacts before tax season every year. Consider having a client appreciation party during the summer or holiday season, where clients are also encouraged to bring their friends. This will help you cement existing business relationships and perhaps find new ones.\n3. Register for online accounts with telecommuting job websites, such as Virtual Vocations or Freelanced. This site's job postings are dedicated to remote workers. You can post your resume for potential employers to see, and you can search by job date, location, travel requirements and employer when you need to look for work. You may also want to pay for a membership with FlexJobs, hea-employment.com. A membership will cost approximately $15 per month or $50 for a year. They also have a guarantee that you will find jobs.\n\t* \n\t* Comb the site ModernTelecommuter. Although this site is not fee based, it combs websites for telecommuting jobs, which can often be outdated. However, its aggregate function may save you time on your job hunt.\n4. Search on large job posting sites like CareerBuilder, Indeed or Monster. Make sure to tick the box that says \"Telecommute\" when searching on these sites. Also, keep in mind that there will be a large amount of competition for any posting, so you will need to apply quickly and often for jobs.\n5. Interview and list yourself with a local employment or staffing agency. Recruiters are always looking for professional contractors that may be able to fill positions with companies. Make sure to be clear about your desire to telecommute and your available time.\n6. Go directly to websites of large accounting firms and businesses. Review their job postings for telecommute positions. Although this takes a fair amount of research, it is becoming more common for businesses to hire remote, part-time workers to take on their accounts receivable and other bookkeeping tasks.\n7. Check back frequently on your local Craigslist site. A lot of part-time work is listed on this site. Businesses or individuals may be seeking an accountant, without having restrictions on where the work is done.\n"}

{"prompt":"So I'm pretty far into writing my dystopian novel and I was reading over what I had.  Something that helps me when I first start a novel is to get a clear picture of my characters in my head and put a face to a name, so I usually sculpt a personality and find a Google image of someone who I think matches that, and I put all of those into documents for my personal reference.  I looked over my main five characters--Analise, Poet, Shove, Star, and Nova--and then suddenly something jumped out at me.  Analise is Hispanic, Shove is Japanese, and Poet, Star, and Nova are all black.\nI had forgotten about their races because it wasn't important to me and I had not noticed while I was writing, because the story isn't about their racial backgrounds.

Even within works about people of color.\n\nSome people will argue that this is exactly the same as novels only including white people. But, no. It isn't.

{"prompt":"When learning some basic French, I was somewhat surprised to learn that phrases of the form \"I have found the cat\" generally translate almost word-for-word from English (J'ai trouvé le chat). To me, it's not immediately obvious that possession (\"I have\"\/\"J'ai\") has a correspondence with past tense, although if I think about it a little more I suppose I can kind of see how it makes sense.\nThis makes me wonder: Is this a common pattern in other languages? Especially ones not closely related to English.","response":"This is what's called a \"Sprachbund\" feature: it's a trait shared by a bunch of languages in an area, even ones that aren't genetically related. In particular, this one is a feature of the \"Standard Average European\" Sprachbund, a group of languages centered in Western Europe, and it's one of the features that was originally used to define that Sprachbund in the first place!\n\nThe construction seems to have arisen back in Latin. In Classical Latin, past aoristic verbs (\"I loved\") and present perfective verbs (\"I have loved\") look exactly the same: both of those would be written amāvī. But it's a pretty useful distinction to be able to make! So in Vulgar Latin, a new construction arose, using the verb habēre (\"to have\"). It's thought that a phrase like habeō litterās scriptās \"I have (written letters)\" got reanalyzed into \"I (have written) letters\", with habēre no longer indicating that you're actually holding anything in your hands, just that an action's been completed in the past.\n\nVulgar Latin eventually evolved into French, Italian, Spanish, and all the other Romance languages, and brought this construction with it; habēre is the direct ancestor of French avoir, via a series of sound changes. And once various Romance languages and Germanic languages and others were all being spoken in the same area, this feature spread through the Sprachbund: people speaking Germanic languages started to use the same construction. English \"have\"\/German haben\/etc isn't actually at all related to Latin habēre, but they looked similar, so it was the obvious choice when adopting the construction into Germanic.\n\nNowadays, this feature is called the \"have-perfective\", and it shows up in all sorts of languages within the Standard Average European (SAE) Sprachbund. It's not at all universal, but can be a good way to determine if a language has been influenced by SAE or not!"}
{"prompt":"Did the ancients or other pre-industrial civilisations engage in unsustainable practices?","response":"Most ancient agricultural practices deplete soil to some degree, but are just fine when population does not exceed certain limits. There are some examples of ancient cultures exhausting natural resources available to them - Pitcairn Island Polynesians, Ancient Puebloans (Anasazi). It's the cause of the semi-nomadic way of life of many early societies - your herds graze the grass into oblivion, you move to another patch to return back when the grass grows back in; or you deplete the soil by overplanting, you move to another spot of land and start over, and so on.\n\nBut there's an important distinction to be made. Early societies were naturally regulated just as animal population are - by food resources. When food grows scarce, hunger strikes, and humans either start fighting for what's left, reducing population to more manageable levels, or migrate to not yet depleted lands - only cases of actual extinction are from island civilizations which cannot readily move. Meanwhile, globally environment stays balanced, and depleted spots are replenished from outside - slowly healing the damage. Modern humanity has no place to move - all land is already claimed by someone, so we have to make do with what resources we have - and consequently affects the world at global scale, which earlier cultures were incapable of.\n\nSustainability is not about return to pre-industrial way of life - it is unsustainable at modern population levels. It is about preserving the environment in human-habitable state - both by taking less from nature and by increasing effectiveness of usage of what we do need to take."}
{"prompt":"Why isn't Sectumsempra an Unforgivable Curse?","response":"Not many people knew Sectumsempra - they'd need to know it exists to  ban it.\nSeverus Snape invented Sectumsempra while at Hogwarts, and wrote it down in his Potions book. He doesn't seem to have told many people about it, it's possible he didn't tell anyone at all.\n\n“Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectumsempra spell, captioned ‘For Enemies’, that he had marked a few weeks previously.” - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nHis book was hidden away until Harry found it, and Harry didn't tell the rest of the wizarding world about it either. Severus himself was seen using Sectumsempra when the Order was moving seven Harrys, and Harry had used it a few times after he found it in Snape's old book. Lupin knows of it, since he described it as one of Snape's specialties.\nHowever, they are probably some of the only people who know it - it isn't widely known like the three Unforgivable Curses. No one else, either in the Death Eaters or the Order of the Phoenix, is ever said to use it.  It's likely that the Ministry didn't even know of it. Therefore, the Ministry wouldn't have even been able to make the decision to classify it as an Unforgivable Curse, since they would likely not have even known it existed.\nIf the Ministry knew about it, would it be classified as Unforgivable?\nThe reason it wasn't classified as an Unforgivable Curse is because the Ministry wouldn't have known about it - they would be unable to make any decision on something they don't know exists. That, by itself, doesn't say whether the Ministry would classify it as one if they knew about it.\nNot all potentially harmful spells are classified as Unforgivable Curses.\nIt's nowhere near guaranteed, though, that if the Ministry knew about Sectumsempra, that they'd classify it as an Unforgivable Curse. There are other spells that could clearly do harm. Just to give a few examples - Confringo, Flagrante, and the creation of Fiendfyre are all potentially harmful but not Unforgivable.\nIt's never mentioned why those three curses are classified as Unforgivable and others aren't, but it seems likely that it's because there are little to no uses for them that aren't evil. The punishment for using an Unforgivable Curse is a lifetime sentence in Azkaban, so only the worst curses, that are highly unlikely to ever have a non-Dark use, would be made Unforgivable.\n\n“Now … those three curses – Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus – are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban.” - Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Chapter 14 (The Unforgivable Curses)\n\nNow, would Sectumsempra fit the criteria for being made an Unforgivable Curse?\nProbably not - it cuts through things like a sword. It can be used for anything a sword, knife or other cutting tool can be used for. While using it on people might be considered Unforgivable, the spell itself is simply the act of cutting. There are many things a wizard might reasonably want to cut with no malicious intent; vegetables, rope, cloth, building materials. Because of this, it seems unlikely that even if the Ministry had known about it, it would be classified as an Unforgivable Curse.\nIn addition, there is a countercurse for Sectumsempra.\n\n“Pushing Harry roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy’s face and repeated his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting. - Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Chapter 24 (Sectumsempra)\n\nWhile the wounds from Sectumsempra can't be healed by simple healing spells, they can in fact be healed by the countercurse.\nSo - Sectumsempra likely wouldn't be made Unforgivable if the Ministry knew it."}

{"prompt":"Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA?","response":"Let the real values data matrix $\\mathbf X$ be of $n \\times p$ size, where $n$ is the number of samples and $p$ is the number of variables. Let us assume that it is centered, i.e. column means have been subtracted and are now equal to zero.\n\nThen the $p \\times p$ covariance matrix $\\mathbf C$ is given by $\\mathbf C = \\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X\/(n-1)$. It is a symmetric matrix and so it can be diagonalized: $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf L \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf V$ is a matrix of eigenvectors (each column is an eigenvector) and $\\mathbf L$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ in the decreasing order on the diagonal. The eigenvectors are called principal axes or principal directions of the data. Projections of the data on the principal axes  are called principal components, also known as PC scores; these can be seen as new, transformed, variables. The $j$-th principal component is given by $j$-th column of $\\mathbf {XV}$. The coordinates of the $i$-th data point in the new PC space are given by the $i$-th row of $\\mathbf{XV}$.\n\nIf we now perform singular value decomposition of $\\mathbf X$, we obtain a decomposition $$\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top,$$ where $\\mathbf U$ is a unitary matrix (with columns called left singular vectors), $\\mathbf S$ is the diagonal matrix of singular values $s_i$ and $\\mathbf V$ columns are called right singular vectors. From here one can easily see that $$\\mathbf C = \\mathbf V \\mathbf S \\mathbf U^\\top \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \/(n-1) = \\mathbf V \\frac{\\mathbf S^2}{n-1}\\mathbf V^\\top,$$ meaning that right singular vectors $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions (eigenvectors) and that singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2\/(n-1)$. Principal components are given by $\\mathbf X \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top \\mathbf V = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S$.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n1. If $\\mathbf X = \\mathbf U \\mathbf S \\mathbf V^\\top$, then the columns of $\\mathbf V$ are principal directions\/axes (eigenvectors).\n2. Columns of $\\mathbf {US}$ are principal components (&quot;scores&quot;).\n3. Singular values are related to the eigenvalues of covariance matrix via $\\lambda_i = s_i^2\/(n-1)$. Eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ show variances of the respective PCs.\n4. Standardized scores are given by columns of $\\sqrt{n-1}\\mathbf U$ and loadings are given by columns of $\\mathbf V \\mathbf S\/\\sqrt{n-1}$. See e.g. here and here for why &quot;loadings&quot; should not be confused with principal directions.\n5. The above is correct only if $\\mathbf X$ is centered. Only then is covariance matrix equal to $\\mathbf X^\\top \\mathbf X\/(n-1)$.\n6. The above is correct only for $\\mathbf X$ having samples in rows and variables in columns. If variables are in rows and samples in columns, then $\\mathbf U$ and $\\mathbf V$ exchange interpretations.\n7. If one wants to perform PCA on a correlation matrix (instead of a covariance matrix), then columns of $\\mathbf X$ should not only be centered, but standardized as well, i.e. divided by their standard deviations.\n8. To reduce the dimensionality of the data from $p$ to $k&lt;p$, select $k$ first columns of $\\mathbf U$, and $k\\times k$ upper-left part of $\\mathbf S$. Their product $\\mathbf U_k \\mathbf S_k$ is the required $n \\times k$ matrix containing first $k$ PCs.\n9. Further multiplying the first $k$ PCs by the corresponding principal axes $\\mathbf V_k^\\top$ yields $\\mathbf X_k = \\mathbf U_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf S_k^\\vphantom \\top \\mathbf V_k^\\top$ matrix that has the original $n \\times p$ size but is of lower rank (of rank $k$). This matrix $\\mathbf X_k$ provides a reconstruction of the original data from the first $k$ PCs. It has the lowest possible reconstruction error, see my answer here.\n10. Strictly speaking, $\\mathbf U$ is of $n\\times n$ size and $\\mathbf V$ is of $p \\times p$ size. However, if $n&gt;p$ then the last $n-p$ columns of $\\mathbf U$ are arbitrary (and corresponding rows of $\\mathbf S$ are constant zero); one should therefore use an economy size (or thin) SVD that returns $\\mathbf U$ of $n\\times p$ size, dropping the useless columns. For large $n\\gg p$ the matrix $\\mathbf U$ would otherwise be unnecessarily huge. The same applies for an opposite situation of $n\\ll p$."}
{"prompt":"How to wear a cowboy hat properly?","response":"Cowboy hats have a long tradition, both for functional purposes while working and as a fashion statement. Even if it seems as simple as setting the hat on your head and going about your business, there are some rules to follow if you want to wear a cowboy hat properly. You need to get a hat that fits right, shape it a little bit, make sure the front is forward, and angle to give your look the proper attitude.\n\n## Choose your hat\n\n1. Get the right size. The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.\n2. Fix your current hat to fit better. You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back. Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat. There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.\n3. Pick the right hat. You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during hot days.\n4. Shape your hat. Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You don’t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands.\n\n\n## Put the hat on your head\n\n1. Adjust your hair. You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this won’t apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Don’t pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option.\n2. Put the bow to the back. One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front.\n3. Angle your brim accordingly. Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.\n4. Pick the right outfit. Your best and simplest bet to wear with a cowboy hat is a button up shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of cowboy boots. The shirt be a plain color or plaid. Flannel shirt work well too. You want basic, straight leg blue jeans with no extra pockets on the sides, no designs or extra buttons on the back pockets, no intentional bleaching or stain marks. Just classic blue jeans. If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. It’s going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on. You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to stretch your quads (quadriceps)?","response":"The quadriceps are a group of four muscles that run down your thighs. Virtually every athletic activity or exercise engages your quads, so it's important for them to be flexible and strong. To maintain healthy quads, stretch them before and after exercise. You can also use yoga to increase the flexibility in your quads, which can make them less prone to injury.\n\n## Warm up your quads\n\n1. Walk or bike for 10 to 15 minutes. A gentle cardio exercise such as walking or biking will get the blood flowing to your quads and make stretching more comfortable. Stretching cold muscles could result in injury. If you're planning on exercising outside in cooler weather, add 5 to 10 minutes to your warm-up time before you start stretching.\n2. Do standing quad stretches before a long run. From a standing position with your knees together, lift one foot and grasp it with your hand. Gently press your foot towards your glutes until you feel a stretch along the front of your thigh. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds, then repeat with the other foot. This stretch can be done both before and after a long run or other physical activity, as part of your warm-up or cool-down. You can also do this stretch while lying on one side. Brace your core to keep your spine in alignment and help stabilize your pelvis.\n3. Add kneeling stretches to target quads and hip flexors. Kneel on the floor on one knee. You may want to rest your knee on a folded towel or mat. Lean forward slightly, with your other foot flat on the floor and your knees at right angles. Lean forward, contracting your core and the glute of the kneeling leg. As you exhale, shift your body forward to stretch your quad and other hip flexor muscles. You can rest your hands on your front thigh for balance and stability. Hold the stretch for a 15-40 seconds, then switch and repeat the stretch with the other leg. Keep your spine neutral and your upper body posture straight. You also want to avoid arching, rounding, or flattening your lower back or pulling back against the lean.\n4. Use lunges for dynamic stretching. Stand with your feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart and step one foot forward. Lower your body by bending at the knees until the back knee is nearly at the floor. Your front knee should be in line with your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor. Raise up and repeat with the other side. You can do a series of lunges where you gradually move forward, or you can stay in the same place. Start with 2 sets of 10 repetitions on each leg. If you have trouble balancing and feel wobbly, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to form a T-shape.\n\n\n## Stretch tight or injure quads\n\n1. Use active range of motion exercises to maintain knee mobility. To complete this stretch, bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion, or as far as you can go without discomfort. You can do this stretch while standing, sitting, or lying down. Choose the position that provides you the most stability and allows you to move your knee the most. This stretch is best soon after an injury, when your movement may be at its most limited. Try to complete 10 repetitions with each leg, but don't overdo it. Stop if you feel pain.\n2. Find a partner for passive quad stretches. Either standing, sitting, or reclining, have your partner grasp your ankle or foot. Your partner will slowly bend and straighten your knee through its full range of motion. When your knee is fully bent, have them hold the stretch for a few seconds before slowly moving your foot back down. Passive quad stretches are a good way to stretch your quads if you don't have the control needed to do standing quad stretches on your own. If you're able to move on your own, passive quad stretches may be of little benefit to you. Communication is key with passive stretching. Don't let your partner push your leg to the point that you feel pain in the muscle. This could lead to additional tearing or re-injury.\n3. Relieve tightness with the couch stretch. Kneel with one knee on the ground in front of a couch. Brace the foot of your kneeling leg on the side of the couch. Your other leg should be straight out in front of you with your knee at a right angle and your shin perpendicular to the ground. Push your hips backward as you press your raised heel towards your glute. You can place your hands on your front knee for balance. Hold the stretch for a few seconds or breath cycles, then release and repeat the stretch with the other leg. In addition to a couch, you can also use a wall or low bench to lean your foot against.\n4. Increase stability and control with supine squats. You will need a stability ball for this exercise. Sit on the ball, then walk your feet forward as you gradually lean back at the same time. When you are lying face up, roll forward and allow your knees to move over your toes until your knees are fully flexed. Then contract your quads and roll back until your knees are at 90-degree angles. Try to do 10 repetitions of this exercise. Only go as far as you can without pain or discomfort.\n\n\n## Improve quad flexibility\n\n1. Lengthen your quads with the crescent lunge. From a standing position, step one foot forward and fold over so that your hands are on either side of your foot. Your front knee should be at a right angle with your shin perpendicular to the floor. Raise up on an inhale, sweeping your arms out to the side and overhead. Lower your hips and press downward into the lunge, stretching and lengthening your quads. Breathe deeply and hold the lunge for 30 seconds to a minute. To get out of the pose, lower your hands over your front leg and then walk or jump your front leg back to meet the other leg. You can raise your hips into downward facing dog if you like, then walk or jump the other leg to the front and repeat the lunge on the other side.\n2. Lower into hero pose. Kneel on the floor, touching your inner knees together. Your feet should be slightly wider than your hips with the tops of your feet on the floor. Exhale and lower your hips onto the floor between your feet until your buttocks are resting comfortably on the floor. Lean forward slightly as you lower, wedging your thumbs into the backs of your knees. Breathe deeply, feeling the stretch in your quads, for 30 seconds to a minute. Open your shoulders and drop your shoulder blades down alongside your spine. If you can't sit comfortably on the floor in this position, place a block to sit on, or roll up a blanket or towel.\n3. Stretch your thighs and core with bow pose. Lie face-down on your mat with your arms by your sides, palms up. On an exhale, bend your knees and raise your feet towards your buttocks. Reach back and grab either your ankles or the tops of your feet and pull them forward. As you inhale, lift your feet towards the ceiling as you raise your thighs off the floor. Breathing can be difficult in this position, but gaze forward and focus on breathing as deeply as you can. Hold the pose for 20 to 30 seconds, then slowly release to lay back down. You can use a folded blanket to pad your ribs and hips to make the pose more comfortable.\n4. Open your hip flexors with pigeon pose. Start on all fours with your knees below your hips and wrists below your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward to the back of your right wrist as you pull your foot around to the left side. The side of your right shin should be lying on the mat perpendicular to your torso. Then slide your left leg back until it is flat on the floor. Exhale and raise up so you are in a sitting position with your right leg crossed in front of you and your left leg extending backwards. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then return to all fours and repeat with your left leg in front and your right leg extended behind you. There are many variations to this pose. For example, try folding over your front leg and resting your chest and forehead on the mat for a more intense hip opener. For a really deep quad stretch, raise your back foot towards your buttocks. Grab your back foot or ankle with your hand and press it towards your buttocks to further deepen the stretch.\n5. Bend into camel pose. Kneel with your legs about hip-width apart. Inhale and draw your elbows towards each other behind your body, allowing your sternum to lift and your rib cage to expand. Press your hands into your heels, maintaining the lifting in your sternum and keeping your shoulders back. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Avoid tightening your glutes. Camel pose helps lengthen and improve flexibility in your hip flexors and upper quads. If it is too much of a challenge for you to reach your heels, you might place a block between your feet or lean back over an exercise ball.\n6. Extend your backbend with little thunderbolt pose. Once you're comfortable in camel pose, take it a step further by lowering your head until the crown of your head rests between your feet. Reach your arms forward to grasp your lower thighs. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To come out of the pose, engage the core and slowly roll yourself back up to a kneeling position. Keep your glutes soft to avoid excess pressure on your lower back. This pose opens up your hips and quads. The practice of lifting up with your chest as you lower your torso backwards is an intense workout for your thighs.\n7. Rest in child's pose. Still in a kneeling position, spread your knees slightly and bring your big toes together. On an exhale, fold over your thighs, extending your arms out overhead and resting your forehead on the floor. Breathe deeply in this position for as long as you want. In addition to being a relaxing way to end your practice, child's pose also works as a good counter-pose after backbends.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to celebrate chuseok?","response":"\"추석\" or \"Chuseok\" is a Korean harvest festival celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar. It is a very popular festival for Koreans as they reunite with their relatives and prepare for a feast. The origin of Chuseok is unsure but it has some traditional rites to be maintained. Thus Chuseok is celebrated in the rich harvest season when fruit and grain are abundant. Using the newly harvested rice, people make steamed rice, rice cakes, and liquor.\n\n## Pray and traditional customs\n\n1. Perform Charye or 차례. This is an ancestral memorial service where the entire family gathers together to perform the memorial service in the morning wearing hanbok. Charye is performed because Koreans believe that their ancestors aren't physically dead; their spirits are still alive. They prepare special food in their honor. Observe the important table arrangement for the Charye feast. Rice and soup are placed on the north side of the table, and fruits and vegetables are on the south. On the west and in the middle, meat dishes are served. On the east, rice cake and some drinks such as makgeolli or soju are placed.\n2. Practice Beolcho \"벌초\" and Seongmyo \"성묘\". Visit the ancestral graves and clean the weeds around the graves. This shows respect and devotion to one another. One month prior to the Chuseok, the families visit their ancestors' graves to clean the weeds, a practice which is called Beolcho, often causing congestion in Korea's highways. They again visit and clean the weeds around the graves during Chuseok.\n\n\n## Entertainment\n\n1. Play Ssireum. A Korean folk game similar to wrestling, it is extremely popular during the festival. Two competitors wrestle in the center of a sandpit and try to knock the other person over by using strength, skill and intelligence. It is a one on one tournament and the last person remaining wins the game.\n2. Perform the folk dance Kanggangsullae. This is a folk dance especially performed by women. They usually link arms and dance in a circle under the moonlight.\n3. Perform Sonori or Geobuknori. \"So\" and \"Geobuk\" literally mean \"cow\" and \"turtle\" in Hangeul. This celebration is a ritual performed by two people wearing a cape made of hanji and running around the local area as a cow and turtle, asking for foods from neighbors. The foods are often shared with relatives who can't afford Chuseok meals.\n\n\n## Food\n\n1. Eat songpyeon or \"송편\". This is a Korean traditional stuffed rice cake served as the Chuseok meal. The stuffings are made of healthy ingredients like sesame seeds, beans, nuts and honey. It is crucial to steam those cakes on pine-needles. It enhances the taste and fragrance along with the meaning of Songpyeon. Songpyeon is also significant because of the meaning contained in its shape. Songpyeon's rice skin itself resembles the shape of a full moon, but once it wraps the stuffing, its shape resembles the half-moon. There's a saying that the prettier you shape your songpyeon, the prettier your future daughter will be.\n2. Enjoy Hangwa. It is made with highly nutritious ingredients, such as rice flour, honey, fruit, and roots. People use edible natural ingredients to express various colors, flavors, and tastes. A few types of Hangwa are Yakgwa, Yugwa and Dasik, which are widely common as Korean confectionery items.\n3. Note that the name \"Hangwa\" is similar to another name for Chuseok, \"Hangawi\".\n4. Drink traditional liquors. These drinks are another significant and traditional side for a Chuseok feast. On Chuseok, families and relatives gather together and hold a memorial service for their ancestors with liquor made of the newly harvest rice. After the memorial service, they sit together and spend some time together as a family, drinking the liquor and eating the food.\n"}

So change all the passwords. Pick a unique, random password for every device and write it down on paper (paper is safe from remote attackers and hard drive failures). 12 random (i.e. computer-generated) lowercase letters represent a good compromise between security and being hard to type. Each device should have a different password so that breaking one doesn't let the attacker break all of them. Enter the passwords in a password manager and use that password manager in the computers you use to control the devices.\n\nIf the device has different authorization channels, for example an administration password and a day-to-day usage password, use different passwords for both and only record the administration password on selected devices.\n\nThe second generic security measure is to ensure that all your devices are behind a firewall or at least a NAT device. A typical home router is sufficient, but you should turn off UPnP which can allow inadvertent back channels from the outside. The goal is to ensures that there's no direct way to connect from the Internet to the device. Connections should always go through a gateway that itself requires authentication to cross, and that you keep patched with any security updates.\n\nYou should also apply security updates on all the device if they exist at all, which can be a problem."}

Fleeing from cannibals, Ning winds up being imprisoned. Sharing a cell with Elder Chu, a renowned scholar, Ning spends apparent months languishing in prison. On the day of Ning's execution, the scholar reveals that he has dug out an escape tunnel. He gives Ning one of his books and a pendant, and sends Ning through the tunnel. Ning obliviously steals the horse of Autumn (Jacky Cheung), a Taoist sectarian. When Ning stops for the night in an abandoned villa, Autumn catches up and the two sort out the misunderstanding. But in the middle of the night, rebel soldiers attack the two visitors. After a short skirmish, the rebel sisters Windy (Joey Wong) and Moon (Michelle Reis) discover Elder Chu's pendant. While Ning mistakes Windy for his love Siu Sin, whom she resembles, the rebels mistake Ning for the Elder Chu. The sisters explain that their father, Lord Fu (Lau Siu-Ming), was framed for a crime and is now being transported to the place of his execution. The rebels' mission is to free him. They set off and leave Ning and Autumn at the villa. The next night, the two discover that the villa actually is haunted by a demon. Autumn manages to injure it, but it flees. He gives pursuit, but without success. He emerges at daybreak on a dirt road, causing an altercation with an imperial convoy led by Fu (Waise Lee). Fu and Autumn battle to a stalemate, and then go their separate ways. Unbeknownst to Autumn, the convoy is the one carrying the sisters' father. Having failed to catch the convoy earlier, the rebels return to the haunted villa, waiting to ambush the convoy there. As the convoy enters, however, the demon returns as well. Maneuvering Fu into fighting the demon, the rebels are able to rescue the sisters' father. Before long, however, the Imperial High Monk arrives with his entourage. He incapacitates the rebels with a spell, which Autumn recognizes as an evil chant. Ning and Windy escape to seek the help of Yin, while Lord Fu, Autumn and Moon are captured by the monk. The captives are brought back to the High Monk's palace. Now suspicious, Fu enters the palace only to find the hollow corpses of the entire royal court inside. Recognizing that the monk is in reality a demon, Fu frees the captives and fights valiantly by himself to allow them time to recover. Lacking spiritual magic, however, Fu is not able to overcome the demon and is destroyed. Just then, Yin and the others arrive. The demon is forced to reveal its true form, a gigantic thousand-year-old centipede. Yin and Autumn are swallowed by the creature, and they separate their souls from their bodies in order to destroy it from the inside. Autumn, however, is not able to return to his body, and his soul floats away. The next day is the marriage of Windy to the Ma family. Ning runs down from his inn to the main street and tells Moon that he wishes Windy a long, happy marriage before leaving. In the desert, as Yin and Ning are about to continue their journey, they see two women approach on horseback, which happen to be Windy and Moon. Windy has escaped from her wedding and decides to leave with Ning."}

That's usually very laborious. \n\n> Are there any guidelines available for determining which to use ?\n\nShallow embeddings are very useful to import result proved in the object logic. For instance, if you have prove something in a small logic (e.g. separation logic) shallow embeddings can be a tool of choice to import your result in Coq.\nOn the other side, deep embedding are almost mandatory when you want to prove meta-theorems about the object logic (like cut-elimination for instance).    \n\n> Is it possible to switch between the two representations in any systematic fashion?\n\nThe idea behind the shallow embedding is really to work directly in a model of the object formulas. Usually people will maps an object formula P directly (using notations or by doing the translation by hand) to an inhabitant of Prop. Of course, there are inhabitants of Prop which cannot be obtained by embedding a formula of the object logic. Therefore you lose some kind of completeness. \n\nSo it is possible to send every result obtained in a deep embedding setting through an interpretation function. \nHere is a little coq example: \n```\nInductive formula : Set :=\n    Ftrue : formula\n  | Ffalse : formula\n  | Fand : formula -> formula -> formula\n  | For : formula -> formula -> formula.\nFixpoint interpret (F : formula) : Prop := match F with\n    Ftrue => True\n  | Ffalse => False\n  | Fand a b => (interpret a) \/\\ (interpret b)\n  | For a b => (interpret a) \\\/ (interpret b)\n end.\nInductive derivable : formula -> Prop :=\n    deep_axiom : derivable Ftrue\n  | deep_and : forall a b, derivable a -> derivable b -> derivable (Fand a b)\n  | deep_or1 : forall a b, derivable a -> derivable (For a b)\n  | deep_or2 : forall a b, derivable b -> derivable (For a b).\nInductive sderivable : Prop -> Prop :=\n    shallow_axiom : sderivable True\n  | shallow_and : forall a b, sderivable a -> sderivable b -> sderivable (a \/\\ b)\n  | shallow_or1 : forall a b, sderivable a -> sderivable (a \\\/ b)\n  | shallow_or2 : forall a b, sderivable b -> sderivable (a \\\/ b).\n(* You can prove the following lemma: *)\nLemma shallow_deep :\n   forall F, derivable F -> sderivable (interpret F).\n(* You can NOT prove the following lemma :*)\nLemma t :\n   forall P, sderivable P -> exists F, interpret F = P.\n```"}

{"prompt":"What are some strategies to maintain morale and productivity after massive layoffs? I am not in a managerial role, just a lead role, and am asking for myself and my fellow employees.","response":"The situation you're describing is tough. Layoffs have a very real impact on both the individuals that are let go and those that remain. I'm sorry you're experiencing this.\nHere are some things to consider that may help you and your colleagues cope with the added stress and emotions following a layoff:\n\n* Acknowledge the layoff and the feelings of your colleagues. Avoiding the topic can extend negative feelings and disenfranchise those most impacted. You should find an opportunity to connect with your colleagues for an honest conversation about your feelings following the layoff.  Perhaps reach out to hold a number of 1-on-1 conversations, or gather your team for an off-site lunch and prompt the discussion.\n* Acknowledge that everyone will be impacted differently. Some of your colleagues will feel totally okay and ready to get back to work.  Others will feel anxious and worried in a way that prevents them from performing the same way they did before the layoff.  There is no right or \"professional\" reaction to a layoff.  Be open to the feelings and reactions of all of your colleagues equally.\n* Create practical solutions to new processes and responsibilities. If your team now has a greater workload, be a generator of solutions.  Try out ideas for making processes in your team more efficient and predictable.\n* Create transparency about the state of the business and potential future staff changes. Layoffs are a clear indication of business trouble.  Facilitate sharing facts about the state of the business and actively work to eliminate rumors.  Additionally, layoffs will likely cause shifts in responsibility as roles are consolidated or reorganized.  Make clear who has specific responsibilities both inside and outside of your team.  Actively eliminate any sources of uncertainty and anxiety that you can.\n* Be a role model. Don't participate in gossip or complaining about the layoff.  Don't disparage management or other colleagues in casual conversation.  Be a model for professionalism and caring.\n* Maintain work standards and a caring meritocracy. A layoff isn't an excuse for allowing work quality to decline.  Additionally, differences in productivity and quality between team members should be consistently and fairly addressed.  If a team member is underperforming following the layoff, provide direct feedback and ask what you can do to help.\n"}

{"prompt":"Why aren't python nested functions called closures?","response":"A closure occurs when a function has access to a local variable from an enclosing scope that has finished its execution. For example, \n\n```\ndef make_printer(msg):\n    def printer():\n        print(msg)\n    return printer\nprinter = make_printer('Foo!')\nprinter()\n```\n\nWhen `make_printer` is called, a new frame is put on the stack with the compiled code for the `printer` function as a constant and the value of `msg` as a local. It then creates and returns the function. Because the function `printer` references the `msg` variable, it is kept alive after the `make_printer` function has returned.\nSo, if your nested functions don't\n\n* access variables that are local to enclosing scopes,\n* do so when they are executed outside of that scope,\n\nthen they are not closures.\n\nHere's an example of a nested function which is not a closure.\n```\ndef make_printer(msg):\n    def printer(msg=msg):\n        print(msg)\n    return printer\nprinter = make_printer(&quot;Foo!&quot;)\nprinter()  # Output: Foo!\n```\nHere, we are binding the value to the default value of a parameter. This occurs when the function `printer` is created and so no reference to the value of `msg` external to `printer` needs to be maintained after `make_printer` returns. `msg` is just a normal local variable of the function `printer` in this context."}

{"prompt":"How to give dawah?","response":"Giving Dawah — inviting people who are non-Muslims or drifting away from Islam to Islam — is an important task and part of practising Amr Bil Ma'ruf Wan-Nahyi Anil-Munkar (calling to good and forbidding the evil). However, the actual job of teaching and preaching Islam is not for the unqualified and uneducated. Proper training and experience is needed to give Dawah. So, how can you effectively and properly give Dawah?\n\n## Prepare yourself to give dawah\n\n1. Make sure you have the right intentions before giving Dawah. You should have pure and good intentions. Oftentimes, many Muslims decide to tell the world about Islam but do it in a way that causes more damage than good, putting themselves in unfortunate situations. Don't give Dawah if your intention is to show off that you are a very knowledgeable person; make sure your intention is to please Allah. Giving Dawah is essentially a special mission to invite people to worship Allah according to the way that He wants to be worshiped. You are delivering a message of truth and showing others how to follow it. The purpose of Dawah is not only to spread the knowledge of Islam but to grow closer to Allah yourself. Take the act of inviting others to Islam as a way to bring yourself closer to Islam as well.\n2. Take a short Dawah course to learn how to give Dawah to a variety of different individuals. You can often find organizations or community groups that come together to teach about Dawah. Most of these courses are free. Some organizations, like Mission Dawah, offer online training or training apps. You can find courses that come in audio, video, or written format for your convenience. Conferences dedicated to teaching how to give Dawah are often held, so be on a lookout in your local area for those. There, you can meet others wishing to give Dawah and learn from educated and experienced teachers and preachers.\n3. Learn how to answer frequently asked questions about Islam. If a Dawah course is not doable for you, there are many materials and resources that talk about common questions people may ask about Islam and how to answer them. Search local Islamic centres for books or the internet to learn what others are asking about Islam. Some questions you might be asked are:\n\t* What is the difference between the words Islam and Muslim? Who is Allah? Who is the Prophet Muhammad? And why do Muslims believe he is the last prophet? What do Muslims believe about Jesus? What does Islam say about homosexuality, abortion, and marriage?\n4. Integrate Islam into your life as much as possible. This means you live and breathe Islam both mentally and physically. You should continue to present yourself as a Muslim as well as bring Islam material into your daily interactions and environments. Maintain the physical appearance of a believer by growing and maintaining a beard and wearing your hijab. Bring Islamic materials to your workplace or where ever you go. This makes giving Dawah easier, as it may spark conversations or questions from others. Bring halal meat to your workplace and share them to others to generate conversations. Pray at your workplace or wherever you are. Let people know prayer is very important to you. You may need to arrange a place or room with your employer and employees in order to pray.\n5. Pray to God and ask for guidance and a sound mind for you to be able to share your faith according to His holy will. For God to answer your prayers, you must live a righteous life and repent any unlawful things you may have done. Truthfulness is one of the most important qualities to have when calling people to Islam. Having this mindset will lead you closer to Allah and also prepare you better for Dawah.\n\n\n## Speak about islam\n\n1. Begin by getting to know the person. Talk to them about themselves, their family, their work, and show that you genuinely care about them. Each person is unique and getting to know them will help you plan the best way to give Dawah to them. Try to find out as much as you can what they know about Islam. Some good opening questions are: How did you first hear about Islam? What do you know about Islam? Or bring up some recent news involving Islam. Do not speak too much about Islam at one time -- let them set the pace. It is best to give Dawah in small doses. Depending on who you are talking to, you can continue the conversation or give literature for them to go through on their own. Giving Dawah is about simplicity. Just be friends with them. Sometimes introducing or reminding someone of the Islam faith is just to be a good friend and show through example. This is especially effective if you know of a Muslim that is straying from Islam.\n2. Ask them if there is anything they do not understand about Islam. You can ask, \"What do you think is wrong with Islam?\" or \"What do you think Islam is?\" Then clear each misconception with as much knowledge and clarity as you can offer. Or point them to the right direction to obtain these answers. Many people will have confused Islam traditions and teachings with ideas that they are already familiar with outside of Islam. For example, people who are familiar with the Christian Bible and its many interpretations may draw the same interpretations when they hear that the Quran mentions Adam and Eve. Some believe that, because of the Bible, society sees women as lesser than men and then have the misconception that women are also oppressed or dominated by men in Islam. Point them towards the Quran and outline the differences between the Quran and the Bible and what these differences mean. In the media and popular culture, many Islamic traditions are the subject of heated debates. The hijab worn by Muslim women is a popular debated topic. You should clarify these misconceptions and lead them to view these concepts of Islam in the framework of Islamic thought which sees the wearing of the hijab as honouring purity of both thought and body.\n3. Say thank you. Thank the person for giving you the chance to share about Islam to them. You might even want to try saying thank you if someone asks you a rude question or insults Islam, as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad. By saying thank you in response to abusive statements, you show others that Islam is, indeed, a good faith. It may also surprise them and make them more open to listen to you. For example, someone might ask, \"Why do Muslim women cover their heads? Isn't this a sign of subjection of women?\" Tell them, \"Thank you for asking me about my religion\" and continue with \"You have an interesting question concerning Islam and I congratulate you for seeking correct knowledge about our faith.\"\n4. Be polite and don't argue or debate with who you are giving Dawah to. Arguing and debating is against the teachings by Allah in the Quran; \"He who gave up disputing while he is right, a palace of high rank in Paradise will be built for him\" (At Tirmidhi). Although your intentions may be good, arguing could lead to disputes and it is best to spread the knowledge in a peaceful way. In Islam, backing down is better than debating. Stop looking for \"loop holes\" in others' beliefs or putting them down for their beliefs. Belittling others is against the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Be more inviting and less defensive. Being defensive or argumentative pushes people away from Islam. It may also hurt people such as your family or friends and even you, bringing in frustration caused by these disputes. In the end, God knows your intentions and will work his will.\n5. Speak the truth. Islam believes that truthfulness is one of the pillars the world's survival depends on. Since speech or speaking is an exclusive human trait, lying is seen as losing your humanity. So when giving Dawah, not only is it important that you do not lie, but also preach that you cannot lie and the faith of Islam is all about truth. You can give examples from the Quran and Sunnah of what lying means and what its consequences are. Some examples of lying are lying when buying and selling, lying about visions and dreams, telling lies as jokes, or being hypocritical. Allah also warns against speaking about everything you hear as you may hear both truths and lies, and speaking about everything could count as lying. Do not tell lies about Allah and His Messengers: “Telling lies about me is not like telling lies about anyone else. Whoever tells lies about me deliberately, let him take his place in Hell.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1229. When you make a statement about Islam, justify it and reference the Quran or Hadith if necessary. If you do not know the answer to a question, say \"I don't know\". Don't lie about your knowledge or spread misinformation. The best way to go about this is to be truthful and direct the person to another source that may contain an answer to their question.\n6. Don't worry if non-Muslims do not accept Islam. The purpose of Dawah is not to convert or convince others to Islam. The decision should be made by the person's own free will.You're duty is to convey the message of truth. Allah guides whom He wills. Ask them, even if they do not accept Islam, what they think of Islam now. This can aid you in future attempts at Dawah or even continue the conversation.\n\n\n## Give dawah in other ways\n\n1. Hand out materials such as a CD, book, or brochure of other more experienced Da'ee (caller of Islam). One of the easiest ways to give Dawah is to spread the message through another Da'ee, especially if you are still working on acquiring knowledge. You can also give a translated version of the Quran. The Quran is your most effective tool in telling others about Islam, as it is the most powerful book at your disposal. Give out leaflets or brochures of upcoming conferences to people or to your local Islamic centre. If you plan to do Dawah in public to strangers, giving material is the best way to engage others in conversation.\n2. Do charity work to help others and also show how Islam has affected your life. Get involved in your local area by helping the old or disadvantaged, or with organizations that help with the environment, community, animals, and much more. Engaging in charity work or sadaqah is a very important virtuous deed in Islam and shows Allah and others your faith in Islam. There are no preliminary requirements in order to give sadaqah and you can should give it freely without any limits or expect anything back. People touched by your charity work will most likely have a more open mind about you and Islam. This makes the message of Islam much easier for others to accept.\n3. Provide materials to your Islamic community by recording lectures, or posting videos. This is especially needed if your community is lacking materials to give to members who have strayed from Islam or cannot attend meetings regularly. It will also bring you closer to others in your local community. The Prophet Muhammad encourages that knowledge be shared and not withheld. There will be people in your community that are not willing to share the knowledge. Do non-direct dawah by using the internet. For example, post Islamic tweets on Twitter.\n"}

It's confusing because it won't work as expected with a slash on neither, though; rsync sneakily always interprets the destination path as though it has a slash, even though it honors an absence of a slash on the source path.

{"prompt":"How to treat a staph infection?","response":"Staphylococcus bacteria are commonly found on human skin and many surfaces. When the bacteria stays on your skin, it's generally fine; however, if the bacteria enters the skin through a cut, scrape, or bug bite, it can cause problems. It can create an infected wound, and if left untreated, can become life-threatening.[1]\nX\nTrustworthy Source\nMayo Clinic\nEducational website from one of the world's leading hospitals\nGo to source\n Seeing your doctor for treatment is a must if you think you have a staph infection.\n\n## Get treatment\n\n1. Look for signs of infection. A staph infection can show redness and swelling. It can also create pus. In fact, it can look much like a spider bite. The skin may also feel warm. These symptoms will generally be near where you have a cut or sore. There may also be pus or discharge draining from the wound.\n2. Seek professional medical attention as soon as possible. Staph infections can develop into a serious infection quickly. Therefore, if you think you have one, you should call your doctor. Your doctor will likely want you to come in as soon as possible, and she will give you instructions for the immediate future. If you have signs of infection as well as a fever, it is especially important you see your doctor. Your doctor may wish to see you immediately or send you to the emergency room for treatment.\n3. Clean the area with an antibiotic soap. In warm water, gently wash the area with soap. You can use a washcloth if you do so gently, but you shouldn't use that washcloth again before washing it. Don't try to pop the wound if it's a blister; that will only spread infection. If your wound needs to be drained, it should be done a by doctor. Make sure to wash your hands after cleaning the area. When you dry the wound, use a clean towel. Don't reuse it without washing it.\n4. Discuss whether your doctor will take a sample. Generally, your doctor will want to analyze a sample of tissue or a culture. The idea is he can check what strain of the infection you have; once identified, he will know which antibiotic that particular microbe is susceptible to.\n5. Expect your doctor to drain it. If you have a bad infection that creates an abscess or boil, your doctor will likely drain the pus from wound. You shouldn't feel much, as she will try to numb the area first. Draining a wound generally involves the doctor using a scalpel to make a small incision across it. After that, she'll let fluid drain out. If the wound is large, she may pack it with gauze that will need to be removed at a later time.\n6. Ask about antibiotics. Most of the time with staph infection, you will need to take a round of antibiotics. One reason staph is so dangerous is because some strains are becoming resistant to certain types of antibiotics. This includes Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which must be treated with IV antibiotics. Typically, you'd take cephalosporins, nafcillin, or sulfa drugs; however, you may need to take vancomycin instead, which is less resistant. The downside to this drug is your doctor must give it to you intravenously. A side effect of vancomycin may be the development of a severe, itch rash. It usually covers the neck, face, and upper torso. You cannot simply look at an infection and know that it is a staph or MRSA\n7. Understand when surgery is necessary. Sometimes, staph infections can develop around a medical device implanted in your body or a prosthetic. If that happens, you may need surgery to have the device removed.\n8. Watch for this complication with other injuries. Staph infections can be a problem in a number of situations, such as when you have surgery. You can also develop a serious condition called septic arthritis when staph bacteria enter a joint, which can happen sometimes when staph is in the bloodstream. If you have septic arthritis, you'll have trouble using that joint; you'll also likely notice quite a bit of pain, as well as some swelling and redness. You should see a doctor as soon as possible if you have these symptoms.\n\n\n## Prevent staph infections\n\n1. Wash your hands often. Staph gathers on the skin, including under your nails. By washing your hands, you are more likely to avoid introducing it to a scratch, scrape, or scab. When you wash your hands, you should scrub for 20 to 30 seconds with soap and warm water; using a throwaway towel afterwards is best. In addition, turn off the faucet with a towel so you don't touch the germy surface after washing your hands.\n2. Clean and cover cuts. When you get a cut or scrape, it's important to cover it with a bandage once you clean it up. Using an antibiotic ointment is also good practice. Doing so will help keep staph infection out of the wound.\n3. Wear gloves if you need to play doctor. If you're working on someone else's cut or wound, it's best to put on clean gloves if possible. If not, make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards and try not to touch the wound itself with your bare hands. You can do things like put the antibiotic ointment on the bandage before placing it over the wound to keep from touching it.\n4. Shower after you exercise. You can pick up staph infection in the gym, hot tub, or steam room, so make sure to shower after you exercise to help wash it off. Always make sure the shower area is clean, and don't share shower supplies, such as razors, towels, and soap.\n5. Change tampons frequently. Toxic shock syndrome is a form of staph infection, and it is often caused by leaving a tampon in for longer than eight hours. Try to change your tampon every four to eight hours, and use the lightest tampon you can get away with. If you use a tampon that is too absorbent, it can increase your risk of a staph infection. If you're worried about toxic shock syndrome, try sticking to other methods to manage your period, such as pads.\n6. Increase the temperature. When doing your laundry, wash your linens, including your towels and sheets, in hot water. Hot water can help kill off the staph bacteria so it doesn't keep infecting you.\n"}

Most scales in Western music conform to a particular key; that is, a sequence of notes that will be sharp or flat by default. Not all scales have keys; the chromatic scale is a scale of all possible semitone steps used in Western music, while the whole-tone scale is a scale composed of intervals two semitones apart.\nWithin a particular key, there are 7 notes in a single octave, before reaching the 8th note which is named the same as the first note and is at double the frequency. The seven notes have differing intervals between adjacent notes; sometimes it's one half-step (semitone), while other times it's a whole step (two semitones). The pattern of whole-step\/half-step intervals that determine the notes of a key, starting from the note for while the key is named, is whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half. Within a single key, each of those seven notes could be used as the base note of an ascending sequence. Each such sequence, created by starting on a different note in the key, is a **mode** of that key, and each mode has a name:\n\n* Ionian - starts on the tonic; the note for which the key is named. In the key of C, the Ionian mode starts on C. This mode is the most common, and colloquially called the **major scale**. The pattern is WWHWWWH.\n* Dorian - starts on the next note higher in the key than the tonic (D, in the key of C). WHWWWHW.\n* Phrygian - starts on the note one major third higher than the tonic (E). HWWWHWW.\n* Lydian - starts on the note one perfect fourth higher than the tonic (F). WWWHWWH.\n* Mixolydian - starts on the note one perfect fifth higher than the tonic (G). WWHWWHW.\n* Aeolian - starts on the note one major sixth higher than the tonic (A). In modern music, this mode is also very important, and is referred to as the **natural minor scale**. WHWWHWW.\n* Locrian - starts on the note one major seventh higher than the tonic (B). HWWHWWW."}
{"prompt":"Summarize the following article with one line: \nWhen journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get.\n\nFor nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. \n\n'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online.  \n\nBaby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry \n\nShady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months\n\nBut the heartbreak did not end there.\n\nAs Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the 'embryo outsourcing' agencies featured in the Vice documentary.\n\nDuring her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies.\n\nAnd if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. \n\nFor the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact 'extra' babies being sold on the black market.\n\nThe agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant.\n\nShocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them\n\nNo morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner \n\nGianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner.\n\n'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. \n\nGianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody.\n\n'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer.\n\nThe sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team.\n\nIn the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money.\n\nCommercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World.\n\n'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element.\n\nNo options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money \n\nDormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth\n\nTight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room \n\nAnd while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a 'cheap' alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family.  \n\nWomen can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives.\n\nBut there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised.\n\nWhen I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second\n\nSurrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day.\n\nGianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section.\n\nDr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession.\n\nAnd while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options.   \n\nDuring the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' \n\nDishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area \n\nNo choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day \n\nToo quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country \n\nShe continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.'\n\nAnother surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'.\n\nGianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation.\n\n'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said.\n\nGianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate.\n\nHe made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival.\n\n'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted.\n\nAs a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority' have no idea this dark underbelly exits.\n\nGianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","response":"Here is the summary: \nVice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series.

{"prompt":"How to kill a fly?","response":"Flies can be annoying pests, especially inside your home. If you can’t remove the flies humanely, you may want to kill them. Use a flyswatter for an easy way to kill a few lone flies. Try using sprays to get rid of numerous flies. You can also kill flies with bait and traps, like fly tape, DIY traps, or Venus fly traps. Eliminating flies can be done quickly, easily, and cheaply, whether you have a single fly or dozens to remove.\n\n## Use a flyswatter\n\n1. Wait for the fly to land. Keep your eye on the fly until it lands, then get ready to make your move. Approach the fly silently and slowly so it doesn't fly away. If you don’t have a flyswatter, you can use other objects with a flat surface, like a newspaper, shoe, or book.\n2. Swat the fly with a quick, downward motion. Raise your flyswatter above your head, and bring it down over the fly in a single, strong move. You are crushing the fly between your flyswatter and a hard surface. If you miss the fly the first time, wait for it to land and swat again.\n3. Wipe up the fly and clean off your flyswatter. Rinse the flyswatter in soap and water, and use a tissue or paper towel to wipe up the mess. Make sure to wash your hands! You can also disinfect with a cleaning solution to prevent spreading any germs.\n4. Try using an electric flyswatter for an easier, efficient option. Electric flyswatters are devices that lure in flies with a light and kill them upon contact. Stand near the fly with your electric flyswatter to kill it effortlessly and quickly. Be sure to read over instructions carefully before use. Avoid touching the racket area, and always let the flyswatter fully cool down before storing it.\n\n\n## Spray the fly\n\n1. Choose from either chemical sprays, household cleaners, or hairspray. Chemical sprays kill flies instantly upon contact, though they contain harsh chemicals. You can also spray the flies with household cleaners, like Windex or Formula 409, or with an aerosol like hairspray. All of these sprays will help you kill a fly. Purchase chemical fly sprays at home supply stores. Look for brands like Hot Shot and Raid. Use spray if you want to remove many flies very quickly. Chemical sprays will kill them the fastest, though they have harmful chemicals. Household cleaners are a cheaper alternative, and you likely have them at home already.\n2. Spray the air near the fly thoroughly. Spray the fly while it is in the air or when the fly lands. Hold in the trigger to release the spray, and spray directly into the air around the fly. You want to saturate the fly in the spray. If you are using chemical sprays, the fly will die instantly. If you are using household cleaners or hairspray, the spray will coat the fly's wings, making it impossible to fly. The fly will still die, just not as quickly as with chemicals.\n3. Leave the room after you spray any hazardous chemical. The chemicals contained in most fly sprays are toxic and lethal. Household cleaners also use chemicals, though not quite as toxic. Avoid inhaling these chemicals by leaving the room immediately after you spray. Leave the room for both chemical sprays and household cleaners. If you have pets or children, they should also avoid the room until the chemicals have settled. You can wait about an hour before reentering the room, so the chemicals can dissipate. This will depend on how ventilated your room is and how much chemical you spray. It is safe to come back into the room when you no longer smell the chemicals.\n4. Dispose of the dead fly and wash your hands. Scoop up the dead flies with a paper towel or tissue, and throw them in the trash can. Make sure you wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water! If you killed multiple flies, throw them all away before you wash your hands.\n\n\n## Remove fly with trap\n\n1. Hang fly paper in areas with many flies for a cheap and easy option. Fly papers, or fly ribbons, are strips of paper coated in a sticky attractant. Flies approach the paper because they are attracted to the smell, and they get stuck to the paper and die. You can hang fly paper near your entrances, above your windows, or next to your trash can, for example. Fly paper can be hung up indoors or outdoors. Replace your fly paper after you collect a handful of dead flies.\n2. Make your own trap for a cost effective solution. You can make your own trap with sugar water, a jar, and a paper cone. Cut a small hole around the point of the paper cone. Pour 1 part sugar and 2 parts water into the jar, and place the cone upside down inside the jar. The flies will be attracted to the sweet smell, and once they are inside, they will get stuck and drown in the liquid. You can add a piece of cut fruit to the jar to tempt the flies further. Try a piece of apple. You can also add a mix of sugar and water to a plastic bottle instead of a jar.\n3. Set out a Venus flytrap for a natural, hands-off option. Venus flytraps are carnivorous plants that feed on insects. The flytrap has a reddish, sweet-smelling interior, which insects mistake as a flower. A fly will land inside, and the flytrap will snap shut. The fly cannot escape, and the flytrap will consume the fly. Place your flytrap in areas popular fly areas, like your kitchen or near your door. Purchase Venus flytraps at most home supply stores or garden centers.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to deal with diagnosis of a rare chromosome disorder in a child?","response":"Most people have heard of Down syndrome. But there are hundreds of other chromosome disorders a child can have, many of which are diagnosed in only a few children, or may even be unique to that child.\n\n## Get information\n\n1. Learn about genetics. Most people have 46 chromosomes, arranged in 23 pairs. One pair is the sex chromosomes, which in males is usually XY and in females XX. The other 22 pairs, known as autosomes, are numbered by size, with chromosome 1 being the biggest. Each chromosome has a longer arm, called the q arm, and a shorter arm, called the p arm. Each arm has bands that are numbered, with the band closest to the middle (centromere) being numbered 11.1. Terminus (shortened to \"ter\") refers to a tip of a chromosome. A \"terminal\" chromosome disorder is not fatal; it just involves the terminus. Learn about the types of changes. Nullisomy means that there are zero copies of a chromosome. Deletion\/monosomy means that there is only one copy of the chromosome or piece of chromosome. Duplication\/trisomy means that there are 3 copies. Tetrasomy and pentasomy refer to 4 and 5 copies, respectively. Translocations are when chromosomes swap material. If it is balanced, this means the same number of copies of material is present, but they are arranged differently - for example they have part of 3q on 2q and part of 2q on 3q, but it all adds up to the same thing. If it is unbalanced, the child has trisomy and\/or monosomy for some part of the involved chromosomes. Very often, an unbalanced translocation is inherited from a parent with a balanced translocation, but it can also occur as a new mutation, which is called 'de novo'. For example, they may have part of 2q missing and part of 3q in its place, causing partial monosomy of 2q and partial trisomy of 3q. In an unbalanced translocation, the abnormal chromosome is called the derivative chromosome, or der for short. So they may write t(2;3)der(2) to indicate the child has the 2 with chromosome 3 material instead of the 3 with chromosome 2 material.\n2. Find medical information on your child's condition. There may not be much out there, but find what you can, because it can give you an idea what to expect for your child. Be careful to pay attention to what specific chromosome region is affected, including what bands are involved - even though they both have 22q deletion, kids with 22q11 deletion have a totally different syndrome from 22q13 deletion. Also keep in mind duplication\/trisomy versus deletion\/monosomy, because these are genetic opposites. When reading medical case studies, remember that they focus on the negative. You're probably not going to hear the doctor talk about how sweet and caring the child is, or how much their parents feel lucky for knowing them, because it's not medically relevant. You will learn about some of the health problems your kid could face.\n3. See if parents have written about your child's condition. Depending on how rare the condition is, there may be other parents out there who have written about what it is like to raise a child who has it.\n4. Look for adults with your child's condition. Many adults with genetic disabilities are able to use computers when they become adults. Do any of them have blogs or social media accounts? They may be able to offer good advice. Here are some benefits of learning from adults with disabilities:\n\t* They can tell you about the parenting strategies that did and didn't help. They may be able to offer detailed advice about your child. Watching them can help you envision what your child's life will be like someday.\n\n\n## Cop\n\n1. Don't assume the worst. Many doctors, when they don't know the prognosis for a condition, will act like it's more severe than it really is. Even parents of kids with very mild chromosome disorders have been told their child will never walk or talk and\/or will die in infancy. If your child has a rare syndrome, take dire prognoses with a grain of salt.\n2. Recognize that infancy is the worst time. For many chromosomal conditions, the first year or two of life are the hardest, as caregivers and healthcare providers try to figure out the child's needs. It won't always be this bad, and it's likely to get easier. If you've been told that your child may die, recognize that extreme early death usually happens in the first 3 years of life, or not at all. If your child is fine at age 4, they'll probably be fine at age 24 and age 44.\n3. Give yourself time to process. You may feel a range of emotions as you realize that your child's life will look different than you thought it would. This is normal. Don't expect yourself to adjust immediately.\n4. Tell other people how they can support you. People around you may want to help, but not know what they can do. Let them know what your family needs, and give them the opportunity to help. \"Between all the doctor appointments, we barely have time to cook. It would be really nice to have someone prepare a meal or maybe invite us for dinner once in a while.\" \"We could really use a babysitter on weekends.\" \"We're so busy for with the baby that the kids can feel left out. If they could go to your house to play with your kids sometimes, it might help cheer them up.\" \"I'm really worried about the upcoming surgery. My wife can't be there due to her conference. It would really help to have someone there with me.\"\n5. Make peace with the fact that life will be different. Your child is going to learn differently, behave differently, and show you how much they love you differently. Sometimes it will be harder, but there will also be beautiful parts. Remember that not every quirk is a deficit. Some differences are positives, and others are neither good nor bad. It's okay for your child to be unique.\n6. Take time for yourself. You can't pour from an empty cup, and you can't help your child much if you're physically and emotionally exhausted. Try to set aside a little \"me time\" each day, even if it's only 5 minutes. Ask yourself \"What would help me feel better right now?\" Could it be a shower? A cup of tea? A hug? Try to get it.\n\n\n## Move forward\n\n1. Seek out parent support groups. If you can find other parents of kids with the same or overlapping chromosome disorders, great, but even parents of kids with completely different conditions can be a great source of support. UNIQUE has leaflets on many rare conditions.\n2. Get therapy early. Early intervention is important. As soon as your child is medically stable, sign them up for physical, occupational and\/or speech therapy - even if they are still a tiny baby. This will help them reach their full potential. Although very few kids with chromosome disorders are so affected that they can't walk or talk, most have some degree of cognitive or learning disability. The more they can do for themselves, the less support they will need from others in adulthood. Take notes during therapy and ask for activities that you can do at home. Bad therapists do exist. If a therapist tells you to be cruel or punitive towards your child, find a new therapist. Childhood should be fun, not scary. You don't want your child to gain an anxiety disorder along with their new skills.\n3. Make time for your child's siblings, if there are any. At times, they may feel left out, especially if you're busy taking care of your disabled child's needs. Try to spend quality time with each of your children every day. If you don't spend time with a child on one day, try to make up for it during the weekend.\n4. Celebrate your child! Your child is different, and they have their own special combination of traits that make them who they are. Love them for who they are, and treasure the good moments. Some conditions, such as Williams syndrome, include positive aspects. Let go of the idea of the child you could have had, and focus on the real child you have right now. They need your love.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to avoid video game addiction?","response":"Video game addiction can be very detrimental to one's health and social life. The following is a steps list detailing how to avoid becoming addicted, and how to un-addict yourself if you are already addicted.\n\n## Step\n\n1. Accept responsibility. The problem lies within the individual, not within the game. No attempt at beating 'addiction' can succeed until the individual accepts its existence. It is not the existence of video games, nor the content of games, but the person who chooses to play them.\n2. Identify the impact. How many hours a day do you spend playing games? Do you normally go out on the weekend? When was the last time you read a book? Identifying the negative impacts of the addiction will help you focus on positive improvements and getting back the things that you really are missing.\n3. Avoid blame. Blaming others for problems that you alone must face does not solve the problems. The 'gaming industry' or manufacturers are not the cause of this problem, and blaming them does not make the problem better. The vast, extreme majority of 'gamers' are healthy individuals, accepting responsibility is the first step.Also , do not make excuses : take responsibility.\n4. Stay positive. While it is important to identify the negative aspects of the problem, it is also important to focus on the goal and progress that you have made.\n5. Set limits. If you decide that you have one hour per day to spend playing games, stick to that. Choose your games correctly! If you are playing a game that requires many hours of gameplay between saves or which is an open-ended game like many MMOs, you likely should consider a different game or different genre of games.\n6. Monitor your child's video game time. You are the parent, and thus you are in control. If your children do not listen to you, removal of the game console or setting of administrative control on the computer may allow you to better handle the problem.\n7. Look in your drawer of CDs. Are there more than 5 games that you have played in the last two months? Are these games open-ended (like Civilization, World of Warcraft, or Evil Genius)? This could be a warning sign.\n8. Add up the total hours played per week. This includes time spent reading walkthroughs and watching videos and discussing games in real life. Always round up! If this number is over 25, then there may be a problem.\n9. Request that your parents put you on a strict time limit for computer playing. There are freeware programs available for download that can help with this. Playing hide-and-go-seek with your parents (hiding your games) is an effective way to minimize gaming overall.\n10. Find something else to do. You know the statement \"my anti-drug...\" This statement is better phrased \"my anti-addiction...\" or \"my anti-bad habit...\" The best way to do this is to develop a variety of other things to do, with others.\n\n\n## Friends\n\n1. Count how many games you play and how long you are playing them.\n2. Fix the problem by finding friends or spending more time with the ones you have.\n3. Step two could be hard for certain people. If you can't, ask a teacher or a parent. If there isn't one available, do it on your own.\n4. Find games to do outside. Play with your friends.\n5. Go get a book at the library. Read together.\n6. Do puzzles that could help your mind. Have contests with your friends.\n7. Come up with new fun games together and stay healthy.\n"}
{"prompt":"My 10-year-old daughter is struggling with transitioning to a new school. How can I help her make the adjustment smoother?\n\n\n","response":"Transitioning to a new school can be difficult for kids in general, as they are trying to figure out who they are, what they like, and how they fit in with their peers. Here are a few ideas for how to help her adjust:\n\n* Talk to her about her feelings. Ask her how she is feeling about the transition. Let her know that it's okay to be sad or upset about leaving her old school and starting at a new one. Let her know that it's okay to feel excited too! \n* Find out what is bothering her, and then help her to find ways to cope. Talking with her teachers may give you some clues, as they may have noticed her acting out in class and can offer suggestions as well.\n* Encourage her to make friends. Remind her that making friends is a skill that can be learned. Talk about ways that she can meet new people, like joining an after-school club or asking a classmate to go to lunch with her. \n* Encourage her to explore her new school. Help her to make a list of the different areas of the school, like the playground, cafeteria, and library. Ask her if she would like to explore the school with you during her lunch break or after school. \n* Encourage her to take responsibility. Try to give her more responsibilities at home. Let her help you to make meals, do the dishes, or fold laundry. Let her know that you trust her to do these things. This will help to build her confidence and sense of responsibility, which will help her to feel more comfortable at school.\n\nThe most important thing that you can do is to let her know that you are there for her if she needs you. Give her some space though, and don't pressure her into opening up if she doesn't want to."}

{"prompt":"How to control chi?","response":"Chi (also known as “Qi” and pronounced “chee”) is a concept that comes from Chinese medicine. Chi is life energy, which is believed to be in everything and everyone in the world. Many people wish to spend time focusing their chi because it is believe to improve health, focus, and well-being. Learning to focus your chi will be an on-going journey.\n\n## Focus chi through movement\n\n1. Practice Tai Chi. Tai Chi can help you with focusing your Chi. It is a light exercise that uses several movements and breathing to help you focus on your Chi. It is believed to help reduce stress and help with many medical conditions.\n2. Find Tai Chi classes. There are many videos for practicing Tai Chi on the web. Simply search for “Tai Chi videos” on your favorite search engine. However, if you have never practiced any Tai Chi before, it is perhaps a good idea to visit a Tai Chi instructor to help get you started. You can also call local gyms and yoga studios to see which ones offer Tai Chi classes.\n3. Try out some of the basic movements. If you aren’t sure whether you would like Tai Chi, or if you feel intimidated to go to a class, you can try out a few of the basic movements first. Begin with your feet at shoulder width. This helps you keep your weight centered. Keep in mind that when practicing Tai Chi, it is extremely important to keep you weight balanced on both of your feet, which when planted on the ground, should stay shoulder width apart. Keep your knees slightly bent. Don’t lock them! Try to position yourself as if you were about to sit down into a chair, which will require your muscles in your legs to engage. Keep your spine straight, but also relaxed. Imagine that each vertebra is floating above the one below it. Touch your tongue to the roof of the mouth gently. This is believed to connect the channels which help chi flow. Thus connecting your entire body. Make a mental connection. This involves mentally thinking about connecting the wrists and ankles, elbows and knees, shoulders with hips. Become aware of your breath. Breathe in a relaxed, normal manner. Follow the inhalation and exhalation, as well as expanding and contraction of your lungs. If you can, belly breathe.\n4. Be present while practicing. Being present in the moment (rather than constantly thinking about the past or worrying about the future) plays a huge role in Eastern Philosophy. This means that when you are practicing Tai Chi (and in your daily life in general) you should also practice being mindful, or fully present, in the moment. In the case of Tai Chi, you should practice noticing physical and emotional sensations you feel while you are actively practicing. Naturally, your mind may wander. In these instance, you should simply try to notice extraneous thoughts that come into your mind, and then go back to noticing the feelings and sensations you are currently experience. Don’t judge the thought, and try not to follow it.\n5. Keep practicing! The idea behind Tai Chi (and focusing and developing your Chi in general, is that you are on a journey. Thus, if you really want to use Tai Chi as a method of focusing your Chi, you should practice consistently. You may find benefit if you practice every day for a month, but you will find even more benefit if you practice a few times a week for many years.\n\n\n## Use chi breathe exercise\n\n1. Practice mindfulness when practicing these breathing exercises. The term “mindfulness” refers to a practice of making a gentle effort to be present in whatever you are currently doing. In this case, this means making an effort to think about the exercise as you are doing it. Think about the way the breath feels as you inhale and exhale. Although your mind will very likely wander to other thoughts, worries, and\/or other things you have to get done, just do your best to come back to the present when you notice that it has wandered. Don’t get mad at yourself when this happens.\n2. Find a comfortable position. This will be different for everyone. If you find that you are comfortable sitting cross-legged on the floor, do that. If you want to lay down or even stand up, that is fine too. Make sure your clothes are comfortable, and that you are sitting with good posture. Inhale through your nose. Do this as you normally would, don’t make it deeper or more shallow. Exhale slowly. Instead of out your nose, exhale out of your mouth as much as you can. Try to get all of the air out of your lungs. Breathe in through your nose. You will find this very refreshing as their was no air in your lungs, but try to breathe normally. Don’t take a very deep breath, but instead take a breath as you normally would. Repeat the process of inhaling through the nose and exhaling through the mouth. Do this as many times as you like. It will help refresh you and make you more alert. However, if you feel dizzy, try taking a break or making your exhalations slower.\n3. Practice belly breathing. In Eastern medicine it is believed that breathing low in the belly is better than using the shoulders to breathe. Lie down on your back. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to do this no matter whether you are sitting, laying down, or standing. However, it’s good to start in this position so you know how it should feel. Rest one of your hands low on your belly, beneath your belly button with a flat, open hand. Take a few normal breaths to relax. Take a deep breath, and then forcefully exhale. The point here is to try and push your hand up with your belly during the exhalation. Your hips and back should not move. Repeat this step until you get the hang of moving your hand using only your breathing.\n4. Breathe in a square. This may sound strange, but it will help you to experience what chi feels like. It involves breaking your inhalation and exhalation down into 4 parts. Begin by sitting in a peaceful, relaxed position. If you choose to sit up, make sure you have good posture. Take a few breaths to relax. If you have mastered belly breathing, then do that. However, if you have not, just breathe normally for a few breaths to relax. Choose an amount of time for your breaths. A good place to start is 5 seconds for inhalation and 5 seconds for exhalation. You can add or subtract time from this if you need. Breathe in for the amount of time you have chosen (i.e. 5 seconds), then spend 5 seconds without inhaling or exhaling (don’t tense up your body here!). Follow this with 5 seconds of slowly exhaling, and another 5 seconds where you stop exhaling and don’t inhale either. Focus on the experience of continually breathing in a square. The feeling you get from this is chi.\n\n\n## Focus chi through meditation\n\n1. Search for videos or apps. If you have never practiced meditation before, you can search the web for videos or for apps for your smart phone that can guide you through a meditation session. If you choose to use a video to guide you, skim through several videos to see if you enjoy the tempo of the guidance, the length, and the content of the guidance. You don’t have to listen to the whole thing before you start, but try to look for a guided meditation for beginners as these will be much shorter and include much more verbal guidance.\n2. Avoid eating for at least half an hour before meditating. A full belly can make you sleepy and weigh you down. When meditating, you want to be awake, but relaxed.\n3. Find a quiet place to meditate. If you can find a nearly silent place to meditate, this is best. If you wish, you can use music to help you focus in your meditation. However, be sure to use music that is suitable for Chi meditation. If you don’t have any such music, you can search sites like YouTube for videos that play the correct music. Simply search for “Chi meditation music” (or try “Qi meditation music”), and you should find suitable music.\n4. Find a comfortable, seated position. If you can, sit cross-legged on the floor. If this is not possible for you, sit upright in a chair with your feet planted flat on the floor.\n5. Rest your hands lightly on your lap. Your hands should rest with your palms facing upwards either on each leg or with your left hand cradling your right hand just below your navel. If you choose the latter, have your thumbs gently touching each other.\n6. Keep your spine straight. This can be challenging at first, but try not to slouch. Instead, practice sitting with your spine straight. While you should try to keep your spine straight, you should not feel tense. Thus, try to keep a straight, but relaxed position.\n7. Relax your gaze. You can choose to gently close your eyes, or keep your eyes open. Either way, begin by resting your gaze in front of you, not focusing too hard on anything in particular.\n8. Become aware of your physical and emotional feelings. Notice the way your body feels as it rests on the floor or chair, and take note of the thoughts and emotions you are feeling at this moment.\n9. Become aware of your breathing. Notice your breathe. Notice the way it feels as you inhale in through the nose (e.g. Is the air cold? Is one nostril more open than the other?) and then notice how it feels as you exhale (e.g. Is the air warmer? Does the air come out slowly or forcefully?). As you breathe in, imagine that you are breathing in good energy. As you breathe out, imagine that you are breathing out toxins and bad energy.\n10. Practice meditation every single day. With meditation it is best to practice every day if at all possible. This may mean that you have to reduce the time that you meditate, which is OK. It is better to meditate for 10 minutes each day than for 30 or 40 minutes only once per week.\n"}
{"prompt":"Can you make a lesson plan for my math class about absolute value?","response":"Here is a one-hour lesson plan for teaching absolute value to sixth-grade students.\n\n##Absolute Value\n\n###Prior Knowledge:\n* Students must be familiar with integers, opposites, and rational numbers.\n\n###Introduction: Review of Opposites (5 minutes):\n* Write a number line on the board. Intentionally leave out a few missing positive and negative numbers, but include 0 at the center.\n* Ask students to identify the missing numbers on the number line and write down on a sheet of paper.\n* Ask one or two students to come up to the board to write the missing numbers.\n* Select a point on the number line and ask a student to come up and show the opposite of that number on the line.\n\n###Teacher Instruction (10 minutes):\n* Show that opposites are the same distance from zero, but in different directions. Demonstrate with the opposites that the students labeled on the number line earlier.\n* Define the absolute value of a number as its distance from zero. Let students find the absolute values of the two opposites from the introduction.\n* Plot another point on the original number line. Ask students to find the absolute value of that number. Let one student explain their answer to the class.\n* Ask students if they notice a pattern about absolute value. Students should notice that absolute value is always positive.\n* Tell students that absolute value is also helpful for understanding real-world situations. Use an elevator example with the ground floor marked as zero. Ask students to measure the distance between underground or overground floors to the ground floor.\n\n###Guided Practice (10 minutes):\n* Provide students with an introductory absolute value worksheet. The worksheet should be as simple as possible.\n* Have students pair with partners to complete this worksheet. Check in on students while they work.\n\n###Independent Work (20 minutes)\n* Provide students with an absolute value word problems worksheet. This worksheet should help students connect absolute value to real-life situations.\n* Have students work independently on these word problems.\n\n###Assessment (10 minutes):\n* Ask students to find the absolute value of some numbers (e.g. -6, -3.5, 17) on a sheet of paper.\n* Write the temperatures -6°C, 1°C, and -3°C on the board. Ask students which is coldest.\n* Collect the students' answers to measure how well students understood this lesson.\n\n###Conclusion (5 minutes)\n* Let a student explain their answer to the temperature problem.\n* Ask students to define absolute value to their partner."}
{"prompt":"How can you tell if someone is being truthful or lying to you?","response":"To tell if someone if being truthful or lying to you, here are a few things to look for:\n\n* Look for inconsistencies in what they say. If one time they said one thing, and another time they said the opposite, or if they contradict themselves within the same conversation, that's a sign that they may be lying. \n\n* Look for signs of stress. Liars often have a harder time lying when they're under more stress. Pay attention to whether or not they seem nervous. Are they fidgeting? Stuttering? Avoiding eye contact? These can all be signs that they're lying to you. However, some people are good liars, and can lie with a straight face. This is why it's best to look for multiple signs that they're lying.\n\n* Pay attention to what they don't say. If someone is lying to you, they may leave out details, or fail to correct you when you make an assumption that isn't true. \n\n* Ask follow-up questions. Liars often give short answers because they're trying to avoid giving details that may incriminate them. Follow up with questions like, \"Why did you do that?\" or \"How did that happen?\" to see if they're fumbling for an answer.\n\n* Ask questions you already know the answer to. This is a great way to catch someone in a lie. If you know the answer, you can say, \"Oh, so it was you who broke the vase, not Kyle,\" and see if they correct you.\n\n* Look for micro-expressions. A micro-expression is a brief, involuntary facial expression that reveals someone's true emotions. People who are lying may make a micro-expression of anxiety or guilt. You have to pay close attention, because these expressions only last for a fraction of a second.\n\n* Pay attention if they change the subject. This is a classic sign of a liar. If someone is trying to distract you from the truth, they may change the subject or try to redirect the conversation.\n\nAnd remember, people lie for many reasons. The simple fact that someone is lying to you does not mean that they are guilty of the crime you are investigating. They may be protecting someone else, or themselves from something embarrassing, or they may be lying about something completely unrelated. Always keep the reason for your questioning in mind, and be prepared to pursue other lines of inquiry based on the information you learn."}
{"prompt":"I was surprised to learn that Puerto Ricans, despite living in a US territory, were not entitled to vote in the presidential elections.\nI was even more surprised to learn that US citizens are allowed to vote for president from anywhere in the world - EXCEPT if they happen to live in Puerto Rico.\nWhat is the legal\/political rationale behind this? What is it about Puerto Rico that magically removes one's right to vote? Has anyone ever challenged this?","response":"This is a peculiarity as a result of the federal nature of the USA and the exceptional position of Puerto Rico as a territory but not a state.  Within the States and Territories of the USA, your voting rights depend on residence.  If you leave the States and Territories your voting rights depend on former residence or inheritance.\n\nIn general most citizens of the USA are also citizens of a state of the USA.  Since states don't issue their own passports, your citizenship of a state is determined by residence.  If a New Yorker moves to Florida, they become Floridians, and so can vote in state elections in Florida, but can't now vote in elections in New York.\n\nNow if our New Yorker moves to Timbuktu, this is treated slightly differently.  They remain a US citizen and a citizen of New York, and so retain the right to vote in New York elections. Their children could also claim New York citizenship.\n\nBut Puerto Rico is both part of the USA but not a State or part of a State of the USA.  When our New Yorker moves to Puerto Rico, they can vote in Puerto Rican elections but not elections in New York.\n\nNow the nature of elections in the US is that there are no national elections  There are statewide elections of Senators, Governors and  Presidential electors.  There are district elections of Representatives and there are local elections of many kinds.  Our New Yorker has lost the right to vote in New York elections (just as they would have done if they had moved to Florida) but not gained the right to vote in Puerto Rican elections for Presidential electors (because there are none).\n\nThis is odd, but something similar is true if the New Yorker moves to DC.  They cease to have the right to vote in elections to the Senate."}
{"prompt":"How to physically flirt with a girl?","response":"Flirting builds attraction and tension, but it has to be done in the right way. Done in the wrong way, the girl you like might scurry off and never look back. Like all flirting, body language attraction is a fun process, but don’t rush it. Slowly position yourself so that you can flirt with your crush with confidence, and most importantly, have fun with it.\n\n## Get her to warm up to you\n\n1. Get to know her. Think about what she likes and her interests. Ask her if you're not sure. Understanding her interests helps you find common ground so that you have a reason to see and talk to her, which brings you one step closer to physically flirting with her. As you get to know her, be kind and considerate or she might not let you get much closer. Go slow. If you walk up and put your arm around a girl without knowing her well or flirting first, she might get offended and think you’re too forward. Flirting gradually over a period of time -- even if it is a short period of time -- is the best way to get a girl to go out with you.\n2. Compliment her. Compliments give you the ability to let her warm up to you so that you can get close to her physically. When you talk to her, give her a compliment that sounds genuine. Otherwise, she might think you’re trying to \"game\" her. Girls like compliments as long as it doesn’t sound like a pick-up line. Superficial compliments might make her shut down and not want to talk to you. Give compliments that are unique to her and be specific. For instance, compliment her cute ears, freckles or eyes. Remember that a lot of girls -- even the pretty ones -- are very insecure. When you try to compliment her, she might not take you seriously because she thinks you are joking. So, reassure her that you’re not. Don’t neg her or give her a backhanded compliment. “You’re pretty for a brunette” is not a compliment. Never make her the object of a joke, and if people say something rude -- even if they're teasing -- tell them to stop. Then, quickly glance at her. If her eyes get bigger or if she smiles slightly, then she is impressed and thankful.\n3. Make eye contact when you speak to her. It not only lets her know that you’re listening, but it also gives her the feeling that she is worth your undivided attention. Eye contact creates tension and attraction. Try to hold her gaze for a while without breaking it -- even if there are distractions around. Ignore them. She will be impressed that you didn’t let the chaos around you distract you from her. Then, she’ll be more likely to open up to you.\n4. Mimic her body language. If she leans forward, you lean forward. If she steps to the side, you step to the side. Mimicking her body language is a subtle way of letting her know that you are into her. Even if she is consciously unaware of this, subconsciously she may start to pick up the signal. Watch her body language as well to see if she mimics you. Mimicry is a sign that she is warming up to you even if she is not quite ready for flirtatious touching just yet.\n5. Give her attention in a crowd. Sometimes girls can feel lost when they are standing in a large crowd or even if she is standing amongst friends -- especially if her friends are attractive. She might think that some of her friends get more attention than she does because they are prettier or more outgoing, which means it can be difficult for her to feel like she is being seen and heard. So, make her feel like she is standing out from the others by giving her more attention. When she speaks, pay special attention. Make a point to talk to her directly instead of speaking to others. When the group is making a decision about where to go or what to do, ask her what she thinks the group should do.\n6. Call her just to talk. Make sure that she knows that you really want to get to know her better. Calling her just to chat -- especially since texting is far more popular -- lets her know that you really are interested in getting to know her better. Chat about her interests or current events. Or, just give her a hello and a short chat to let her know you’re thinking about her. You don’t need to be some extreme version of yourself that doesn’t really exist. Just be “normal.\"\n7. Bring her something. Nothing major. It can be something small like a snack item that you see her eating often. Make sure that you come off like an observant person and not a creepy stalker who likes to watch her. Don't be put off if she refuses your gift. She may not want to immediately accept something from you. She doesn’t want to feel as if she is indebted to you because you gave her something. If you ask a couple of times, she may eventually give in and accept it.\n8. Text her to ask you to meet you somewhere. If she agrees to meet you, don't comment on any other girls or talk about subjects that would make her think you aren't interested-- unless you know she likes those subjects. You don’t want her to think you only like her as a friend. You want to make her feel special, not like just another member of your group\n\n\n## Sneak to touch her\n\n1. Touch her knee against yours. Slowly move your knee toward hers until they touch lightly. Make sure that you touch her knee gently and then linger, so she doesn't think that you are bumping her leg because you need more room for your legs. Flirting by accidental touch helps build attraction because it creates tension. Small touches here and there leaves her wanting more. But remember to keep your eyes open for mutual signals. If it doesn’t look like she’s enjoying it, stop.\n2. Touch her hand or arm when you laugh. Say something funny, or laugh at her jokes and then laugh. While you’re laughing, gently touch the top of her hand or forearm as if to say “ you jokester.” This should look casual and natural. It should look as is if you do this to everyone when you laugh. If you are sitting down when this happens, take this opportunity to casually slide your chair closer to hers.\n3. Tuck her hair behind her ear. This works best if she has a strand of hair out of place or a strand hanging in her face. Gently, tuck the hair behind her ear so that it is out of her face.\n4. Put your hand close to hers. When you are sitting next to her at a table, always place your hand so that it is really close to hers. A finger length apart or a little more is a good distance. To take it a step further, place your hands on hers for just a second as if it is accidental.\n5. Play footsie. If you're sitting at a table\/desk across from her, gently put your feet on top of hers. It may seem like playing footsie is a little childish, but it is a way to get a girl’s attention in a playful manner while also letting her know that you’re interested. If she looks under the table and smiles, then she is happy that the person gently kicking her is you.\n\n\n## Flirt with her overtly\n\n1. Hug her. It’s a reason to touch her in a non-sexual way. It’s also a legitimate reason to touch her without seeming too flirty especially if you greet her with a hug. If you do this every time you see her, she will begin to understand that hugging is the way that you greet her.You could possibly get a hug every time you see her. If you want to take it a step further, hug her more frequently. Give her hugs for no reason if you know her fairly well. With time, this may escalate and she might start giving you hugs. However, also keep in mind that some people just don't like hugging. So, it is important to pay attention to her body language and facial expressions. If she doesn't like it, stop; and of course, if she tells you to stop, you should stop immediately.\n2. Play with her hair. Some girls like this. Focus on the hair at the nape of the neck because playing with her hair in this area will probably give her chills -- in a good way. If she is comfortable with you, play with the hair close to her torso or bustline. (Be respectful though.) From there if the girl is still comfortable, take it a little further. With the back of your hand, gently push the hair hanging in front of her shoulders behind her shoulders. (Please don't do this if it looks like the girl worked a long time to style her hair. Even if you are just trying to flirt with her, she will get mad at you for ruining her hair.) If all is well, start to rub her neck like you’re giving her a neck massage.\n3. Put your hands around her waist from behind. If she likes you, she'll most likely lean back on you. Touch her gently so you don't startle her. If you two get really comfortable she might even let you slide your hand down a little lower. Once she’s comfortable with you putting your hands on her waist, grab her and swing her around. Then, she’ll be facing you. Lean in and whisper something in her ear, or just say it outright. You’ll be able to tell if she liked it by the expression on her face. (Beware: Some girls are extremely ticklish and tend to involuntarily squeal or giggle when someone touches their waists).\n4. Push her playfully. When you're walking next to her on a sidewalk or path, gently push her off the path. She'll probably push you back, which will start some playful flirting. Because even childishly pushing each other is a way of flirting. (Don't do this on a busy road though. Someone might get hurt.)\n5. Put your head in her lap. If you're already friends and you're watching a movie, reading, or just talking with friends, go over and lie your head in her lap. Let her play with your hair. If she pushes you off, just laugh. This only works well if you’ve flirted with this girl many times before.\n6. Tickle her. Good areas for tickling are under her ribs or the sides or her stomach. If she likes you, she'll tickle you back -- probably while smiling or laughing. Watch her signals though, if she doesn't like it or if she pulls away, stop. You don’t want to annoy her and ruin any chances of getting close to her again. If she pulls away, revert back to the physical touching that she seems to be comfortable with and do that for a while.\n7. Be respectful. Pay attention to her body language and anything that she says. You don't want to overstep her boundaries. Overt touching should be consensual, and some people are uncomfortable with public displays of affection or being touched at all. Everyone is different, so it is very important to pay attention to her verbal and non-verbal cues. If she says, \"stop\" at any point, then stop. If she looks uncomfortable, stop. She'll perceive you as invading her space and possibly harassing her. Neither are attractive or respectful.\n"}
{"prompt":"This guy claims that Olympic powerlifters working in the 1-6 rep range can increase strength without increasing muscle size. \n\n> Trained Olympic lifters, for example, were shown over a two-year period to have significant strength increases with barely noticeable increases in muscle mass (Hakkinen et al, 1988). I had a similar experience when I used AST's Max-OT principals. My strength went up like crazy, but I gained very little size. Obviously, traditional strength training with low volume and low sets (1-6 reps, 3 or less sets) is not the best approach. Strength training does cause hypertrophy (Hakkinen et al, 1985), but it won't cause maximum hypertrophy.\n\nWhat is the scientific explanation for this? Is the inverse true? That is, can a buff guy (with lots of prominent muscle) actually be weak? ","response":"Certainly there is a correlation between muscle mass and strength, but there is more to the story. Two reasons why muscle mass and strength may not be completely congruous are:\n\n* Muscle fiber density\n* Muscle utilization\n\nDensity:\nYour muscles are composed of four different types of fibers (slow-twitch, and three forms of fast-twitch). These fibers have different profiles in terms of force applied and recovery time. Slow twitch fibers, for example, recover quickly but have less force as there are fewer muscle fibers per bundle, compared with the fast-twitch fibers. \nExtra water in the form of glycogen can also cause muscles to take up more volume with the same amount of actual muscle. This glycogen can be a ready source of energy for the muscles, but isn't going to increase their maximum theoretical force for a single heavy lift (per Olympic competition) where endurance through a long set isn't at issue.\nUtilization:\nThe average person is able to utilize 20-30% of their total theoretical muscle strength when trying their hardest. (Ref. Tsatsouline, Power To The People) Top lifters use perhaps 50% of their theoretical strength. Olympic and powerlifting-style training focuses on training the neural pathways to utilize a greater percentage of the available muscle mass. Since muscle fibers contract all internal cells (the all-or-nothing principal), this training is focused on convincing a greater proportion of fiber bundles to contract during a lift. \n\nCan a buff guy be weak? \nWell, it depends on your definition of buff. A cut guy can be weak (compared to a strength athlete), because muscle definition is more about having low body fat covering the muscle than it is about having large muscles. \nA bodybuilder with decent volume won't be able to lift as much as a comparable powerlifter because he\/she doesn't train for strength per se. It seems worth noting that Olympic\/power lifters also want to minimize their size (except for the heavyweights) because it affects their weight class in competition, so there is an added incentive to train for neural utilization over additional muscle mass."}
