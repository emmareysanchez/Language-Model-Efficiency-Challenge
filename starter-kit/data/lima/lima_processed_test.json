Here is a suggested daily food plan. Note that this is just an example and you will have to do some of your own research to figure out what works for you.\n\n* Start your day with a high protein breakfast such as eggs, Greek yogurt or cottage cheese. Avoid carb heavy breakfasts such as pancakes, waffles, sugary cereals, etc. which will just spike your blood sugar and leave you hungry a few hours later.\n* Eat a healthy lunch including a protein, some veggies and some carbs. Avoid high carb lunches such as sandwiches, pasta, etc. that will make you drowsy and unproductive in the afternoon.\n* Eat a healthy dinner with protein, veggies and healthy fats. Avoid large dinners that will make you feel bloated and uncomfortable.\n* Snack on nuts, seeds, veggies (carrots, celery, etc.) and high protein snacks such as Greek yogurt.\n* Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Aim for at least 8 glasses.\n\nIn addition, to keep a healthy life, get some exercise. Even if you can't make it to the gym, you can do pushups, situps and other exercises at home. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, park further away from your destination and walk, etc."}

{"prompt":"How to hook up with an ex girlfriend?","response":"## Get ready to hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Keep it spontaneous. If you want to hook up with your ex without any strings attached and to have as much fun as possible, then you have to start off by being spontaneous. Don't call her or text her, asking what she's been up to. Instead, you should run into her at a club, a party, or just out in the middle of the day, and start charming her and letting her know that you want to hook up. If you call her or start checking in with her, then she may get the wrong impression and think you want something more than just hooking up. Treat it like meeting a new and exciting girl out at a bar and then bring her home.\n2. Let enough time pass. If you want to start hooking up with your ex, you should wait until at least a few weeks, if not a few months, have gone by before you start trying to hook up with your ex again. Even if you had an amicable and mutual break-up and there are no hard feelings, you should let the dust settle before you try to get back in bed with your ex, or things are bound to get complicated. Enough time should pass that you can see your ex as someone hot who you'd like to hook up with, instead of letting all of your old complicated feelings or emotions well up at the sight of her. Enough time should pass so you get rid of any anger or lingering resentment or bitterness.\n3. Let her know you want to hook up. Once enough time has passed and you've run into your ex, you should make it clear that you want to take her home. Don't tell her that she's beautiful and that you've missed her smile; instead, tell her that she looks great in her new dress and that you've missed her body. You don't have to be too subtle since you should already be pretty comfortable with each other -- just make sure she's feeling it, too. Don't give her a puppy-dog love gaze. Look her up and down and let her see that you think she looks hot. Be blunt. Ask her to come over or wait for an invitation to go to her place.\n4. Make your intentions clear. Before you even touch your ex's lips with your own, you should make your intentions and expectations clear. Tell her you want to hook up without any strings attached, that you're not looking to get back into the relationship, and that you just want to have a little fun. Let her know that you only want to see her to hook up, not to do all the date-y stuff that leads to hooking up. Don't be a jerk. It's not cool to lead on your ex, hook up with her again, and then tell her that you're not really looking to reconnect.\n5. Make sure you're on the same page. Keep in mind that, when you're about to hook up with an ex, it's pretty unlikely that you're both on the same page. That is to say, it's almost always the case that one of you is still hurt, still reeling, and still emotionally vulnerable from the break up. It could be the case that she dumped you and you're pretending that you want to hook up when you really just want to get back together, or that she's totally hung up on you while you just want to get her in bed. But if you really are looking for the same things, then it's safe to go for it. Look into her eyes when you talk about your hook-up status. Does she really agree that it's a good idea, or does she clearly think it'll turn into something more? Think about how serious the relationship was in the beginning. If you were only together for a month or two, then you're both much more likely to be okay with just hooking up than you'd be if you dated for a year or two. Make sure you're both okay with also hooking up with other people. If you're not, then why not just get back together?\n\n\n## Hook up with your ex-girlfriend\n\n1. Make sure you only hook up. Though it sounds harsh, if you're going to hook up with an ex, then you should only hook up with her. Be honest about it. Don't make an excuse every time your ex wants to go somewhere public with you. Tell her that you're not looking for anything other than hooking up.\n2. Hook up sparingly. Hooking up with your ex can be fun and exciting, but that doesn't mean you should do it every night, because guess what? That's starting to look like a relationship. If you're basically only hooking up with your ex, then you're not letting yourself meet other girls or have any fun on the side. The more time you spend together, the more likely you both are to be hurt, so keep it fun and spontaneous instead of setting a hook-up date for every night of the week. Keep it fun and spontaneous. If you see her out, then take her home. If not, then don't call her or text her to find out where she is. You're not supposed to care that much, remember?\n3. Don't get too comfortable. It can be tricky to hook up with an ex without feeling too comfortable. No cuddling, no passionate kisses as you leave, and no hanging out around the house in sweatpants eating cold nachos from the night before. All of these signs show that you're too comfortable in the non-relationship and that you're on your way to dating again.\n4. Stay in control. If you want to hook up with your ex without any trouble, then you have to maintain control of the situation at all times. Don't let her set the terms of your hook up, and try to keep things at her place so you remain the master of your own domain. Don't cancel your plans to hang out with your buddies if she wants to hang out; tell her you'll hang out with her if she's free. This doesn't mean you should tell your ex exactly what to do; you should find a time and place that works for both of you, but you shouldn't fall prey to her needs.\n5. Keep your new relationship private. Don't hang out with your ex in front of your friends, go to a party with her because she doesn't want to show up alone, or tell your friends that you've been hooking up with her again. The more people you bring into it, the more complicated things will get, and you should keep it simple -- just between the two of you. If you start going out in public with her and hanging out with her friends, they'll immediately disapprove and tell your ex that she should set the terms for your relationship. If you bring her out in front of your friends, then she'll start to feel like your girlfriend again.\n6. Avoid \"lovey dovey\" stuff when you're hooking up. Maybe when you were dating, you would be tender with your woman, telling her how beautiful she is, how much you love her, and how much you love the little dimples in her cheeks. Well, all of your Romeo-moves have to go out the door at this point, or she'll get the wrong picture. She'll think, \"He said I'm beautiful -- he must still love me,\" or \"He ran his hands through my hair -- it has to mean something.\" By doing this, you'll be leading her on and making her feel like you still want to date her. You can tell her how hot she is and how much you love her body, but stick to the sexy -- not the tender -- compliments if you want it to last.\n\n\n## Know when to stop hook up\n\n1. Stop if one of you starts developing feelings again. Unfortunately, it'll be hard to keep hooking up with your ex without having one of you develop feelings for the other person again. As soon as that happens, you'll have to push the eject button on the non-relationship, or things will only get worse from there. Unless you're still really in love with your ex and are using your hook up moves to win back her heart -- incidentally, a terrible idea -- you should cease and desist the second you or she shows signs of having feelings. If you start getting that achy feeling in your heart and start musing about what a great relationship you had while knowing it can never work, then it's time to leave. If your ex tells you she misses you, sends you sweet (not sexy) texts, or says she wishes you could do some couple-y things together, then it's time to bow out. If you have to end the \"relationship\" for this reason, explain yourself first. You shouldn't be a jerk just because it's over.\n2. Stop if one of you starts liking someone else. If one of you starts developing feelings for someone else, even if you haven't pursued that person, you should end up the hook-up period. Hooking up with your ex is something to do when you both want to get some action and are bored because there are few romantic prospects in your lives. But if one of you does start liking someone else, it's time to stop hooking up so you have room to explore those feelings. If you know your ex has a crush on someone else, you're doing her a disservice by continuing to hook up with her and taking up her time. If you start liking another girl, she won't want anything to do with you if she knows that you're hooking up with an ex-girlfriend.\n3. Stop when you've fallen into a routine. Hooking up with your ex should last a month or two at most before things start to get more serious. Even if you're both trying as hard as you can to keep things casual, if you've fallen into a rhythm, basically feel like you're dating, and know exactly when you'll see each other next, then it's time to stop hooking up. If you know when you'll see your ex next, and you stop feeling a thrill at the prospect of hooking up, then the fun is over. You can't expect the hook up to last more than a month or two without it leading to something more. Be realistic.\n4. Stop if you start fighting like a couple. As soon as you start fighting again, you should end the relationship. If you're not actually dating, then you shouldn't be fighting. It's that simple. If you hear her say, \"Where is this taking us?\" or \"What does all of this mean?\" Then she's already back in relationship mode, and your hook up sessions have gone too far. You shouldn't be fighting about anything one of you is doing wrong, because you should only be hooking up, right? It may be tempting to fight with your ex again if you're used to it, but remember that it won't lead you anywhere except back where you were -- a bad relationship.\n5. Stop if you're no longer having fun. The whole point of hooking up with your ex is so that both of you can enjoy yourselves, get some sexual pleasure, and have fun without any strings attached. If you're not feeling the hook up anymore, if you feel like you're only in it out of obligation, or if you're hooking up with your ex just because you're bored, then it's time to start looking for someone new. You weren't having fun before and that's why the relationship ended. Be honest about ending the hook-up session. Don't just start avoiding or ignoring your ex. Let her know it's time to move on.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to make your own decorations for halloween?","response":"There are thousands of Halloween decorations you could go out to the store and buy, but often they look generic and plastic-y, don't they? Why not make your own? Using household items, you can make your own ghosts, bats, spiders, and pumpkins! Here's how.\n\n## Ghostly spirit jugs\n\n1. Clean several plastic milk jugs. You don't need to cut them out or in any way modify them -- they just need to be clean. Each one will be one ghost -- how many milk jugs do you need?\n2. Draw a face on the jugs. You can either use a black permanent marker, felt, or any material you have lying around the house. The permanent marker will be the easiest to make a detailed face with. While you do this, only work on the side without the handles and leave the caps on the jugs. The air forced to stay inside by the caps will make it easier to work with, keeping it sturdy. You don't have to go Martha Stewart on this project. Just a circle for a mouth and circles for eyes (leave a little white for the pupils) can be cute, too.\n3. Cut a small hole in the back of the jug. Use a craft knife to cut a hole the size of a half dollar or a bit bigger than a pound coin. Place the hole about 2\/3 of the way up the jug. This won't be seen. If it's not perfect, don't worry about it. Just don't leave any sharp edges!\n4. Stuff the jug with Christmas or fairy lights. You can either use a whole string for one jug, or thread several jugs with a single string. Arrange the jugs together, plug in the cord, and voila! These little buggers work great lining a walk or a patio or table edge. They dim the lighting just enough to glow in a very Halloween-y feel!\n\n\n## Flapping bats\n\n1. Cut a body, two wings, and the head of a bat (with ears!) out of a piece of paper. You can find a template online or you can freehand it. Make the body a little on the chubby side so you have room to attach the wings without drawing away from its size.\n2. Trace your template onto black craft foam. Cut out the foam to match the template. This project looks best if you have about 6 or so bats. They need friends!\n3. Punch several holes into the bat to join the pieces together. Punch two holes on each wing, close to where the wings would attach to the body. Leave a little space around all sides so the holes don't turn into rips. Also punch a hole at the bottom of the body, to attach a string later (around where a tail would be). The holes just have to be big enough to put a metal brad through. This is how the wings will flap.\n4. Align the holes on the body and the wings together and fasten with a brad. Since there are two holes on each side, use the one that's closest to the wing tip. Place a paper fastener or a brad through the hole and secure loosely (it's best to use a black fastener or color your gold brad).\n5. Thread a string through the empty holes and tie in a loop. That's why you pierced two holes in each bat initially! You'll probably want at least 10 inches (25 cm) of string (or dental floss), so the string is easy to grab. This is how you'll manipulate the wings. When you hang your bat up, you can just give the string a tug and away he'll go!\n6. Attach a ribbon and red sequin eyes. Thread the ribbon through the bottom hole to hang the bat upside down from your wall or ledge. Tie it in a loop and knot. Then, make red eyes with sequins. Googly eyes work, too!\n\n\n## Flowerpot pumpkins\n\n1. Purchase a few terra cotta pots. Having a variety of sizes will give you a pumpkin family! Make sure they're clean if you had them laying around the house. You want them very orange to simulate pumpkins.\n2. Cut the parts of a face out of yellow craft paper. If you don't have craft paper, use scrapbook paper, card, or wrapping paper. Anything that's bendy and colorful will work. Make arched evil eyebrows, a handlebar mustache, surprised eyes, or any detail that you'd like your pumpkin pots to have. The simpler your face, the more it will look like a jack-o-lantern. Give it a toothy grin, a triangular nose, and triangular eyes to make it look more pumpkin-esque.\n3. Brush the surface of the pot with outdoor modge-podge. You only need a layer on the side you'll place the face for right now. Use a sponge brush or paint brush for best results. A thin, but even layer is ideal.\n4. Apply the pieces of the face to the upside down pot. Press them firmly into place. Then, apply a thin layer of the sticky stuff all over the pot, effectively weather-proofing it.\n5. Insert a stick into the end for a stem. When we say stick, we mean stick. Go outside under a tree and find a stick to fit through the bottom of your terra cotta pot. And there it is -- a pumpkin that won't rot in a week's time!\n\n\n## Giant spooky spiders\n\n1. Cut off the spout of an empty, clean milk jug. Just below the lid is what you don't want. Use a craft knife to make this easy -- scissors will be difficult to work with. Make sure your milk jug is clean! If there's still a milky residue it may end up smelling.\n2. Cover the jug with black tape. This will form the body of your spider. Go as tightly around the handle as you can; but don't worry -- if it's still discernible, that's fine.\n3. Get 4 6-foot (2 m) black foam pipe insulation tubes that are 1\/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter. These will be the legs. Tape each one in the center along the handle of the jug. Then, tape the tubes along the sides of the jug too, to make it look as if the legs are going along the body. The tubes will bend into place.\n4. Cut a slit at a joint in the legs. If you cut a slit in the tube, it will bend at your cut. If you hold it in the bend, you can tape it to stay permanently bent. This will form the joints in your spiders legs. A 1\" (2.5 cm) triangle cut is good -- the tube won't unexpectedly break off. Just hold it at its bending point and wrap tape around the newly-formed joint.\n5. Use two halves of a plastic Easter egg for eyes. They'll bulge out and be adequately creepy -- especially if you cut a slit of black tape for pupils. If you don't have an egg lying around, puff balls (or anything circular, really) work as well. Just attach them to the jug with more tape or glue.\n\n\n## Adorable hanging ghosts\n\n1. Create your ghost form with two small paper cups. Turn the first one upside down, then place the second one on top of that. To make it stable, tape or glue the bottoms together. You won't actually be using the cups as part of the ghost -- it's just used for sizing in the initial stages. So if you don't want to fuss with tape, don't worry about it!\n2. Inflate a small balloon and put it in the top cup. But not too much! If it's too big it won't fit in the cup. Make it so it fills out the cup, like a round poof of whipped cream tops a mug of hot chocolate.\n3. Soak pieces of cheesecloth in fabric stiffener. You'll want to work with pieces that are about 8 inches (20 cm) square. Grab a bowl and fill it with fabric stiffener, soaking each piece thoroughly. About 10 seconds per piece will do the job nicely.\n4. Immediately drape over the balloon. After you've soaked a piece, drape it over the balloon and move onto the next piece. Center the pieces, evenly draped over the balloon, but not perfectly uniform. Once you've finished with all your pieces, let it dry for about ten minutes. It will then harden and take shape.\n5. Pop the balloon! This will require a needle or other pointy object since you can't go smashing your creation on the floor (well, you could, if you get really frustrated -- but that'd defeat the purpose). After you do so, you should be left with a free-floating white ghost-like creation. Isn't Halloween the best?\n6. Remove from the cup and rough up the edges. The ends should look tattered, as if they're wafting in some sort of unregisterable-to-humans breeze. Just bending them with your fingers should do the trick.\n7. Attach felt eyes and fishing line to hang. Little tiny black dots for eyes are all these little guys need to be cute and not at all ominous. Black sequins or beads can work, too. As for the fishing line, just thread it through the cheesecloth, loop, and tie in a knot! Hang your new buddies from lights, shelves, windows, or the ceiling.\n\n\n## Eyes in a bush\n\n1. Get an empty toilet paper roll, and a glowstick. You can easily find both at a dollar store.\n2. Cut out two football shaped eye holes. Place them about two to three inches (5 to 7.5cm) apart.\n3. Put the glowsticks in the center of the toilet paper roll. Do not cause them to glow until they need to be used as a decoration on the night of Halloween.\n4. Put the roll(s) in your bushes\/trees. When you cause the glowsticks tot work, you will have scary eyes in a bush!\n\n\n## Paper bag ghosts\n\n1. Obtain rubber bands and a white paper bag.\n2. Draw a ghost face on the paper bag.\n3. Put the rubber band around the middle of the bag.\n4. Decorate. Add the face of a ghost and any other designs.\n5. Hang up from the ceiling, on branches, etc.\n\n\n## Scary halloween candy bowl\n\n1. Get a fake hand, a bowl, glue, and candy. The glue must be non-toxic as food is going to come into contact with it.\n2. Glue the fake hand onto the bottom of the bowl.\n3. Let the glue dry for about two to three hours.\n4. Fill the bowl with candy.\n5. Set the bowl out for the trick or treaters.\n"}

While this line has a rather straightforward interpretation, it also prepares the listener for the following line, which is more complicated.\n\nThe second line, \"Now I'm here to split U like two and three from five,\" refers to the isotope uranium-235, whose symbol in chemistry is U235. This isotope was used in the development of the atomic bombs in the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer makes a play on words, saying that he will \"split U\" (you) like the nucleus of the uranium-235 atom during fission. In addition, 5 is the result when you add 2 + 3."}

{"prompt":"How to feel happy when christmas is over?","response":"Christmas season is filled with excitement and fun. Families come together to celebrate and exchange gifts, and decorations change the landscape of cities and towns. Once the holiday is over, however, the lack of excitement can leave you feeling down. Get back into a good mood by being thankful for your good times, planning for the next holiday or picking up a new hobby.\n\n## Be thankful\n\n1. Reflect on the holiday. When you feel sad that the holiday is over, cheer yourself up by thinking about all of the good times that you had. There are bound to be a lot of great memories from the holiday, so focus on those when you feel upset. Go through photographs from the holiday. If you're from a family that takes a lot of photographs or videos of family gatherings, look through some of them if you're feeling low after the holidays. They'll be a great reminder of all of the fun you had. Talk to the people you celebrated with. It's never to early to begin reminiscing. Speak with your friends and family members that celebrated with you and talk about the good times at Christmas. They're bound to be able to cheer you up with a funny story from the holiday.\n2. Get excited about your gifts. While gifts aren't the only good thing about the holidays, they can make make you happy when you're sad about the holiday ending. Play with toys or gadgets, read books, and make use of all of the gifts you've been given. They'll be a welcome distraction.\n3. Spend your Christmas money. If you received money or gift cards, go out and treat yourself. You'll be cheered up by new purchases, and you may be able to forget that the holiday is over. Go out to eat or visit stores for a good distraction.\n4. Write thank you notes. Send messages to the people who got you gifts and thank them for a great holiday. Not only will you be doing a good deed, but you'll be recalling memories of the times that made you happy. Use the notes to talk about how much you enjoyed the holidays, and how you can't wait to spend time together next year.\n\n\n## Plan for the next holiday\n\n1. Replace decorations. Decorations are one of the best parts of Christmas, but if you leave them up, it may make you even more sad that the holiday is over. Even worse, the empty walls left behind by decorations you've stored may make you feel even more sad. Find creative ways to redecorate your house now that the holiday is over. Buy some plants. Greenery will spruce up your home, and you'll be able to care for the plants throughout the coming spring. Buy a new poster or painting. Large Christmas decorations like wreaths or wall-hangings can be replaced with a new poster or painting. Look for something colorful and exciting to accent your home. With a new piece of art where your decorations were, you may not even notice that your wreath is gone. Put up pictures from Christmas. Replace some of your Christmas decorations with photos from the holiday. You'll have a reminder of the good times to replace the actual decorations. Decorate for winter. Winter can be a beautiful time of year if you learn to appreciate it. Decorate your home for the season with a lot of white items, vases accented with twigs, snowflake decorations and evergreen sprigs.\n2. Plan for New Year's. Christmas may be over, but New Years is right around the corner. Plan a New Years party to get into the spirit of a different holiday. Invite any family and friends that visited for Christmas and you'll get to spend more time with them.\n3. Plan for next Christmas. While it may seem a little early to be get ready for another Christmas, it may be helpful to think about what your next Christmas will be like. Make some invitations, and plan what gifts you will give to others. Your plans might change throughout the course of the year, but you'll be able to make your plans into a good distraction.\n\n\n## Pick up a new hobby\n\n1. Exercise. Exercising will put you in a much better mood and help you burn off some of the extra Christmas-food calories. Go for a jog, lift weights or play a sport with some friends. If you live in a cold climate, January might be too chilly for much outdoor activity, so look into a gym membership or indoor sports leagues.\n2. Start a new hobby. If you've received any hobby-oriented Christmas gifts like paints, kitchen utensils or a new video game, put them to use. Throwing yourself into a new hobby and learning a new skill will help take your mind off of your sadness.\n3. Volunteer. Volunteering can help you keep your Christmas spirit alive as you help those in need. Look into helping out local soup kitchens, shelters or charities that distribute winter clothes. You'll be able to help others through the winter and take your mind off of the end of the Christmas season.\n4. Try to keep a positive attitude. While it may be depressing that Christmas is over, always try to keep up a good attitude. Remember that this Christmas isn't the last one you'll ever have, and focus on things that make you happy as much as possible. It may be especially hard to keep a positive attitude if you have to go back to work. However, think of your return to work as a blank slate and new beginning. Remind yourself that you can start back to work at a slow pace and catch up on your own time.\n"}

{"prompt":"How do I change the author and committer name\/email for multiple commits?","response":"Here is the solution, but be careful if you have a multi-user repository - this will change all commits to have the same (new) author and committer.\n```\ngit filter-branch -f --env-filter \"\n    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME='Newname'\n    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL='new@email'\n    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME='Newname'\n    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL='new@email'\n  \" HEAD\n```\n\nChanging the author (or committer) would require rewriting all of the history. If you're okay with that and think it's worth it then you should check out git filter-branch. The manual page includes several examples to get you started. Also note that you can use environment variables to change the name of the author, committer, dates, etc. -- see the \"Environment Variables\" section of the git manual page.\n\nSpecifically, you can fix all the wrong author names and emails for all branches and tags with this command (source: GitHub help):\n```\n#!\/bin\/sh\n\ngit filter-branch --env-filter '\nOLD_EMAIL=\"your-old-email@example.com\"\nCORRECT_NAME=\"Your Correct Name\"\nCORRECT_EMAIL=\"your-correct-email@example.com\"\nif [ \"$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL\" = \"$OLD_EMAIL\" ]\nthen\n    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\"$CORRECT_NAME\"\n    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\"$CORRECT_EMAIL\"\nfi\nif [ \"$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL\" = \"$OLD_EMAIL\" ]\nthen\n    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=\"$CORRECT_NAME\"\n    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=\"$CORRECT_EMAIL\"\nfi\n' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags\n```\nFor using alternative history filtering tool `git filter-repo`, you can first install it and construct a `git-mailmap` according to the format of `gitmailmap`.\n```\nProper Name <proper@email.xx> Commit Name <commit@email.xx>\n```\nAnd then run filter-repo with the created mailmap:\n```\ngit filter-repo --mailmap git-mailmap\n```"}
{"prompt":"How do I get a ```PriorityQueue``` to sort on what I want it to sort on?\nAlso, is there a difference between the ```offer``` and ```add``` methods?","response":"## Java 8 solution\nWe can use ```lambda expression``` or ```method reference``` introduced in Java 8. In case we have some String values stored in the Priority Queue (having capacity 5) we can provide inline comparator (based on length of String) : \nUsing lambda expression\n```PriorityQueue pq=\n                    new PriorityQueue(5,(a,b) -> a.length() - b.length());\n```\nUsing Method reference\n```PriorityQueue pq=\n                new PriorityQueue(5, Comparator.comparing(String::length));\n```\nThen we can use any of them as:\n```public static void main(String[] args) {\n        PriorityQueue pq=\n                new PriorityQueue(5, (a,b) -> a.length() - b.length());\n       \/\/ or pq = new PriorityQueue(5, Comparator.comparing(String::length));\n        pq.add(\"Apple\");\n        pq.add(\"PineApple\");\n        pq.add(\"Custard Apple\");\n        while (pq.size() != 0)\n        {\n            System.out.println(pq.remove());\n        }\n    }\n```\nThis will print:\n```Apple\nPineApple\nCustard Apple\n```\nTo reverse the order (to change it to max-priority queue) simply change the order in inline comparator or use ```reversed``` as:\n```PriorityQueue pq = new PriorityQueue(5,\n                             Comparator.comparing(String::length).reversed());\n```\nWe can also use ```Collections.reverseOrder```:\n```PriorityQueue pqInt = new PriorityQueue(10, Collections.reverseOrder());\nPriorityQueue pq = new PriorityQueue(5,\n                Collections.reverseOrder(Comparator.comparing(String::length))\n```\nSo we can see that ```Collections.reverseOrder``` is overloaded to take comparator which can be useful for custom objects. The ```reversed``` actually uses ```Collections.reverseOrder```:\n```default Comparator reversed() {\n    return Collections.reverseOrder(this);\n}\n```\noffer() vs add()\nAs per the doc \n\n  > The offer method inserts an element if possible, otherwise returning false. This differs from the Collection.add method, which can fail to add an element only by throwing an unchecked exception. The offer method is designed for use when failure is a normal, rather than exceptional occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity (or \"bounded\") queues.\n\nWhen using a capacity-restricted queue, offer() is generally preferable to add(), which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception. And PriorityQueue is an unbounded priority queue based on a priority heap."}

{"prompt":"I have a myth: Earth has no moon, instead it has a ring. There is ringlight every night year-round, and a ring shadow somewhere on Earth every day, which moves with the seasons. Re-write mythology.","response":"Long before the days of the War of the Gods, Titans reigned over the face of the Earth.  As with any rulers, there were some who ruled fairly and others who did not. Among the more benevolent leaders was Hyperion, the Lord of Light. He was called upon for wisdom and discernment; mortals valued his insight and praised his control of the heavenly bodies.\nYet Hyperion had one great love: Theia, his consort. She was a Titaness of radiance, a mother goddess who shone like the sun on all who sought after her. The two Titans were very much in love, and their love gave vibrancy to the life around them. They were happy - for a time.\nThat time ended when the Gods declared war on the Titans, with Zeus at the forefront of battle. Cronus, Hyperion's brother and Lord over all the Titans, called Hyperion into battle against the upstart Gods. Knowing the war would end in defeat, Hyperion left anyway, answering the call of his brother and king.\nBut before he left, Hyperion gave Theia a gift: a ring of radiant light to wear around her finger. He told her that the ring would tell her if he was safe; that the ring would glow with a silver light when he was in danger. Theia took it gratefully and bid her lover farewell. It was the last time she would see him.\nHyperion fell during the war and was banished with the other Titans to the pits of Tartarus. During the battle, Theia watched in helpless anguish as the ring shone brighter and brighter until it was nearly as luminous as the sun. In her despair, she removed the ring and prayed to the Mother Gaia that she would cause the ring to grow as large as her love for Hyperion. Gaia listened, and so the ring grew.\nNow the ring encircles the Earth, a strip of radiance that gives off silver moonlight every evening. Mankind looks up to the ring and is reminded of Theia's anguish, as well as her love for her fallen lover."}

{"prompt":"Tell me an interesting fact about geography.","response":"Here are some interesting facts about geography:\n\n*  Bhutan is one of the most intriguing places in the world. The Buddhist kingdom is the only carbon-negative country on Earth, with strict environmental laws and cultural norms that preserve its stunning natural landscape. For similar reasons, Bhutan was one of the last countries to introduce television in 1999, and has no traffic lights to this day.\n\n*  There are currently few territories on Earth that are unclaimed by any sovereign state (terra nullius). One example is Bir Tawil, along the border between Egypt and Sudan, which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1902. The territory remains unclaimed by either country, because it would entail forfeiting the much larger Halaib Triangle, which is claimed by both countries. Bir Tawil has no settled population, but the land is used by Bedouins who roam the area.\n\n*  The antipode of any spot on Earth is the point on Earth's surface diametrically opposite to it. Some interesting approximate antipodes include pairs of capital cities, such as Wellington (New Zealand) - Mardrid (Spain), and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) - Lima (Peru)."}

Here is the reason why:\n\nA gasoline (petrol) molecule is made up as such:\n\nC8H18 (or 8 Carbon atoms and 18 Hydrogen atoms)\n\nEnergy is obtained from the combustion of it by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water. The combustion of octane follows this reaction:\n\n  2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O\n\nOr better said, you have two of the hydrocarbon molecules along with 25 oxygen molecules, they swirl together into a mix, the spark plug ignites them, boom, and out the tail pipe comes 16 carbon dioxide molecules and 18 water molecules ... at least in a perfect world. Some cars don't put out exactly that ratio. There may be a little bit of carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (C8H18), and\/or nitrogen oxide (NO2) coming out of the engine exhaust port along with the CO2 and H2O. In this case, the catalytic convertor's job is to help clean these up so you can get closer to the perfect ratio described above.\n\nAs described, the water coming out of the tail pipe is a natural occurrence of the combustion process. You will usually see it coming out of the tail pipe when the engine and exhaust system of the vehicle is not completely warmed up. When it does become completely warmed up, you won't see it any more, because it comes out as steam (well, you'll see it in the winter time if it's cold enough, but you get the idea). "}

This means you have to be patient and accept that you'll be playing nursery rhymes for a while.\n\nOn the other hand, you have some advantages over a child:\n\n* You can understand more abstract concepts. This means you can learn more efficiently, and don't have to rely on muscle memory as much.\n* You have a greater capacity for focused concentration. A child's attention span is very short. This means you can get more done in a single practice session.\n* You have a better sense of dedication and perseverance. A child will give up the moment it becomes difficult. You, on the other hand, will stubbornly keep trying until you succeed. This will get you through the initial stages much faster.\n\nThe conclusion is that it's not too late for you to learn the piano, but it will take a lot of effort and discipline. If you're willing to put in the work, you will succeed."}

{"prompt":"In India, we eat rice using our fingers. Generally in the West, a fork or spoon is used. I have tried eating rice with spoon but I don't feel satisfied with it.\nWe eat dry rice but we mix curry and vegetables with it and then eat it with our hands.\nIs there a way to eat rice with your hands in front of Westerners such that it doesn't appear to be disgusting to them? By disgusting I mean that they shouldn't feel like vomiting or looking away to avoid me. Even though in India we eat with our fingers, many people eat such that their whole palm is covered with food. That indeed looks disgusting. \nI cannot avoid hurting them by following different etiquette, but I certainly want to maintain a degree of cleanliness.","response":"First and foremost, you can eat the way you want. When it comes to western culture, the only thing that is generally disliked are noises, eating with the mouth wide open (included speaking with full mouth), and (excessively) dirtying the table. Eating rice with hands will be seen (mostly) as strange, not disgusting.\n\nSecond, context. Are you eating at a formal dinner with your colleagues and a client? Eat with the fork, as everybody else. Are you eating at the work's canteen? Eat the way you prefer and let other deal with their limits. And so on.\n\nThird, respect and open mindness: you are worried other peoples find you disgusting for eating rice with hands, but at the same time you show the same \"closed mind\" (in a way, ok? I'm not trying to offend you) in wanting to eat rice with hands at all cost otherwise you will not feel satisfied; believe me, eating with a fork will not starve you as will not change food nutritional content.\n\nEven more if you are eating at a foreign restaurant, e.g. at an italian restaurant rice is cooked and thought to be eatean with a fork. Respect local culture, open yourself to a new experience, and try to learn a different way to enjoy food.\n\nIn the end: feel free to do whatever fit you most, don't be afraid of other people judging you (their fault), but at the same time don't close yourself in your garden (your fault)."}

{"prompt":"How do you know if you're in a healthy relationship?","response":"It is important to understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" answer to your question. Every relationship is different, and there is no single way to define a \"healthy\" relationship.\n\nThat said, there are some general guidelines that you can use. One of the most important things to remember is that a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself, and you should feel that your partner respects and values you as a person.\n\nAnother important aspect of a healthy relationship is honesty. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being open and honest with your partner. Your partner should feel the same way towards you. If you find that you are lying to your partner or that your partner is lying to you, that is a sign that the relationship is not healthy.\n\nIn addition, equality is also an important aspect of a healthy relationship. In a healthy relationship, neither partner should feel that they are \"superior\" to the other, and neither should feel like they are \"inferior\". The relationship should be equal in every way.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that a healthy relationship takes work. You shouldn't expect a healthy relationship to be perfect. You will have arguments and disagreements just like any other couple, but how you deal with those disagreements is what makes the relationship healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to know if your relationship is healthy is to ask yourself if you feel comfortable being yourself around your partner, if you feel like your partner respects you, if you feel like your partner is honest with you, if you feel like your partner is equal to you, and if you feel like you can talk to your partner about anything. If you can answer yes to all of those questions, then your relationship is probably healthy."}
{"prompt":"Which is more widely supported: ```window.onload``` or ```document.onload```?","response":"When do they fire?\n```window.onload```\n\n* By default, it is fired when the entire page loads, including its content (images, CSS, scripts, etc.).\n\nIn some browsers it now takes over the role of ```document.onload``` and fires when the DOM is ready as well.\n```document.onload```\n\n* It is called when the DOM is ready which can be prior to images and other external content is loaded.\n\nHow well are they supported?\n```window.onload``` appears to be the most widely supported. In fact, some of the most modern browsers have in a sense replaced ```document.onload``` with ```window.onload```.\nBrowser support issues are most likely the reason why many people are starting to use libraries such as jQuery to handle the checking for the document being ready, like so:\n```$(document).ready(function() { \/* code here *\/ });\n$(function() { \/* code here *\/ });\n```\n\nFor the purpose of history. ```window.onload``` vs ```body.onload```:\n\n  A similar question was asked on codingforums a while\n  back regarding the usage of ```window.onload``` over ```body.onload```.

{"prompt":"Why did people start using CO2 (instead of e.g. oxygen) for carbonated drinks?","response":"CO2 tastes good! Carbonated water is actually a weak carbonic acid solution; this is what you taste. It's like \"salt and pepper\", but for water.\n\nSlightly acidic water is usually popular, hence lemon juice is sometimes used to taint a jug of water in times when no carbonated water is available.\n\nCarbonated water releases CO2 bubbles for many minutes after pressure is released (dissolved carbonic acid reforming), which is an important presentation effect that other gases do not generally have.\n\nIn many countries the local water supply is slightly alkaline (due to limestone rock being very common), and this can leave a bad after-taste, and make food in your mouth taste soapy. The addition of weak acids to water helps with neutralising this effect.\n\nAround the world, some lucky towns have natural springs with effervescent water (carbonated water), and man-made carbonated water is just imitating this. In history people have often travelled great distances to try effervescent water, so its popularity is well recorded.\n\nNitrogen is used for water pressurisation in brewing and cooking as it leaves little or no taste, and generally does not form other chemical compounds. It's used mainly when bubbles are required, but not an acidic taste.\n\nOxygen is unsuitable for water pressurisation as very little can be dissolved at normal soda pressures, and it has no taste, but may readily form unwanted chemical compounds.\n\nIn the 18th century, Joseph Priestley was the first person to document this manufacturing discovery. He noted precisely that it tasted good, and that it was similar to the German Selters water. He was discovering \"airs\" (gases), and uniquely identified quite a few different gases. CO2 was the only one he listed as tasting good. His cheap source of CO2 was the fermenting grains from the nearby brewery."}
{"prompt":"I noticed that there is a binary executable ```\/bin\/echo``` on my Ubuntu MATE 17.04 system.\nI thought, that's odd, because\n```$ type echo\necho is a shell builtin```\nCursory testing suggests that ```\/bin\/echo``` does the same sort of thing as the Bash builtin ```echo```:\n```$ \/bin\/echo foo\nfoo\n$ \/bin\/echo $USER\nzanna\n```\nSo, why is there another version of ```echo``` separate from the Bash program, and why or when would I want to use it?","response":"If you open up a ```bash``` prompt and type in an ```echo``` command, that uses a shell builtin rather than running ```\/bin\/echo```. The reasons it is still important for ```\/bin\/echo``` to exist are:\n\n* You're not always using a shell. Under a variety of circumstances, you run an executable directly and not through a shell.\n* At least in theory, some shells don't have an ```echo``` builtin.  This is not actually required.\n\nTo expand on #1, suppose you wanted to move all the regular files whose names started with ```abc``` anywhere in ```src``` to ```dest```. There are several ways to do that but one of them is:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec mv -nv {} dest\/ \\;\n```\nBut suppose, rather than just running that, you want to see every command that will be run first. Well, then you can prepend ```echo``` to the command, just as you might in other contexts:\n```find src -name 'abc*' -type f -exec echo mv -nv {} dest\/ \\;\n```\nBut ```find``` doesn't use a shell. That runs ```\/bin\/echo```.\nBesides ```find``` with ```-exec``` or ```-execdir```, the ```\/bin\/echo``` executable will be called by other programs that themselves run programs but not through a shell. This happens with the ```xargs``` command (which is related to ```find```), as well as in a number of other contexts, such as the ```Exec=``` line of a ```.desktop``` file. Another example is when you run ```sudo echo```, which can be handy for testing if ```sudo``` is working.\nSimilarly, some shells have a ```printf``` builtin but ```\/usr\/bin\/printf``` also exists.\nA less common possible reason you might deliberately use ```\/bin\/echo``` is if you were relying on the differences between it and the ```echo``` command provided by your shell. ```man echo``` documents ```\/bin\/echo```; ```help echo``` in  ```bash``` documents the ```bash``` builtin. ```echo``` is not very portable, because different implementations--both across operating systems and across shells on the same operating system--support different options (e.g., ```-e```) and differ in their treatment of backslashes. Of course, it's better to avoid relying on such details, and use ```printf``` instead, which is far more portable.\nIn ```bash```, you can make the ```type``` builtin show ```\/bin\/echo``` as well--assuming ```\/bin``` is in your ```$PATH``` as it always should be--by passing it the ```-a``` flag:\n```$ type -a echo\necho is a shell builtin\necho is \/bin\/echo\n```"}
{"prompt":"Why is Gaia operating around Earth orbit? Why not send it to Neptune's orbit?","response":"Well, you thought about the spatial aspect of a parallax measurement, but not about the temporal one.\nGaia's intention is to measure 3D positions as well as 3D velocities. For the distance, you need accurate parallactic measurement, which come in with your orbital period.\nFor a typical Gaia-star with several measurement per year, you'll get 5 values of the parallax after 5 years of time, which you then average. If you'd send Gaia towards Neptune (besides the fact that no one has ever sent an orbiter, to say nothing of a L2 mission that far out) that has a period of 168 years, then after 5 years you'd get... 5\/168 th of one paralactic measurement.\nIt simply couldn't achieve its science goals if put around the L2 behind Neptune. Also no one on this planet has any experience in putting something into a outer system L2 point. This is different than putting it into Earth's L2, because reaching the L2 around one of the giants has vast and very precise $\\Delta v$ requirements. This would be a massive technological leap, and things don't work that way in space. Small, incremental technological steps are required in an anyways unfriendly environment, to make sure everything works properly and no millions of dollars have been wasted.\nCompare that to Gaia's predecessor, the Hipparcos satellite, which was parked in geostationary orbit.\nNow you could still say, why not use Jupiter hypothetically anyways. Well, the orbital period there is still 11 years, and Jupiter's L2 still suffers from the intense radiation environment that is provided by Jupiter's magnetosphere. This would lead to rapid degradation of the CCDs used for scanning across the sky."}
{"prompt":"Why don't toilets use saltwater?","response":"The main answer is logistical. Building a network of pipes to convey water to houses is a major effort, and most places where that's been done found it extremely expensive. Providing a second set of pipes to bring salt water to houses would probably cost about the same. Except that cities go to considerable lengths to put their water reservoirs above the city as far as possible so they don't have to use as much energy for pumping. The few cities with seawater above them pay a lot to pump water out.\nA minor secondary problem is that sewage treatment plants are fairly heavily biological. They grow things in the sewage to break it down. But most of those things won't grow in salt water. It's already a challenge keeping toxic chemicals out of the sewage. For this to work it might be necessary to add a second set of sewer pipes to carry the water away, and develop new methods of treating that salty sewage (the treated sewage couldn't be spread on farmland, for example).\nIt would be far simpler, cheaper and more reliable to simply buy everyone a composting toilet to replace each toilet they currently have. As a halfway measure, mandating more economical toilets would help, as would education campaigns like the  ones encouraging people not to flush at all when they urinate. Even with a sensible cistern that has a 2 litre &quot;half flush&quot;, that's two litres wasted every time someone pees.\nAdditionally, salt is not good for pipes. A lot of pipes, even today, are clay or concrete, and salt water is bad for both of these. It's not impossible to get around that, just expensive."}

{"prompt":"Slater type orbitals (STO) are considered to be more accurate than gaussian type orbitals (GTO) for atomic and molecular QM calculations because - among other reasons - they decay with $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. But GTOs are more popular because they are easier to calculate with. GTOs decay with $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, so its adequate to sometimes add diffuse functions to the GTO basis set to compensate for gaussian decay behaviour.\nAlso, exact hydrogen wavefunctions decay exponentially, so the motivation for STOs.\nI understand that the only boundary requirement for solving the Schrödinger equation for atoms and molecules in free space is that the wavefunction goes zero as $r \\to \\infty$, but there are no a priori requirements for the way it decays as it does so.\nMy question is: do we have theoretical (ab initio) and\/or experimental reasons to believe that all atomic and molecular wavefunctions decay like $e^{-\\alpha r}$ as $r \\to \\infty$.","response":"I'll answer this question from the theoretical side. The exponential behavior follows simply from the Schrödinger equation. Consider the one-electron Schrödinger equation:\n$$\n(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}))\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nAt spatial points that are very far away from the nucleus, $V(\\mathbf{r})\\approx 0$, so that the asymptotic solution is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = \\epsilon\\psi(\\mathbf{r}), \\epsilon < 0\n$$\nThis differential equation has basic solutions of the form\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nfor some unit vector $\\mathbf{k}$. The real asymptotic behavior of $\\psi(\\mathbf{r})$ is thus a linear combination of these basic solutions. The linear combination may bring a polynomial prefactor to the exponential, but will never alter the exponent. Thus we have not only proved the exponential behavior, but also derived the correct exponent $\\alpha = \\sqrt{-2\\epsilon}$. For a multi-electronic, non-interacting system, the overall decay rate is governed by the slowest decaying orbital, i.e. the HOMO.\nOf course, the real wavefunction can only be described by a multi-electron Schrödinger equation. But we can work on the equivalent Kohn-Sham system and show that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays at a rate given by the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy. By Janak's theorem, the Kohn-Sham HOMO energy is just the negative of the ionization potential of the exact system. To see this, consider a huge ensemble of $N$ identical, non-interacting molecules. If we remove one electron from the ensemble and let the hole delocalize evenly between all the molecules, then as $N\\to +\\infty$, the electron removal has a negligible impact on the electron density of any molecule (and therefore the Kohn-Sham potential of each molecule). Therefore under the Kohn-Sham framework we see that removing such an electron costs an energy of $-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ (it does not matter whether the HOMO refers to that of the ensemble or that of a molecule, since their orbital energies are equal), since the electron is taken from an energy level whose energy is $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$ and the Hamiltonian is not changed in this process. On the other hand, from the perspective of the real system it is clear that the energy cost is equal to the first ionization energy of one of the molecules, $I$. Therefore we have $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}} = -I$, which means that the Kohn-Sham wavefunction decays like (again up to a possible polynomial prefactor; the precise determination of this polynomial prefactor is a much more difficult question)\n$$\n\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = Ce^{-\\sqrt{2I}\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nAlthough the Kohn-Sham wavefunction is fictional, its density is equal to the true multielectronic density, and in order for the true density to have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham density, the true wavefunction must have the same asymptotic behavior as the Kohn-Sham wavefunction.

{"prompt":"How do I initialize a TypeScript Object with a JSON-Object?","response":"This question is quite broad, here are two solutions.\n\n### Solution 1: Helper Method\nHere's an example of using a Helper Method that you could change to fit your needs:\n```class SerializationHelper {\n    static toInstance(obj: T, json: string) : T {\n        var jsonObj = JSON.parse(json);\n        if (typeof obj[\"fromJSON\"] === \"function\") {\n            obj[\"fromJSON\"](jsonObj);\n        }\n        else {\n            for (var propName in jsonObj) {\n                obj[propName] = jsonObj[propName]\n            }\n        }\n        return obj;\n    }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var json = '{\"name\": \"John Doe\"}',\n    foo = SerializationHelper.toInstance(new Foo(), json);\nfoo.GetName() === \"John Doe\";\n```\n\n* Advanced Deserialization\nThis could also allow for some custom deserialization by adding your own ```fromJSON``` method to the class (this works well with how ```JSON.stringify``` already uses the ```toJSON``` method, as shown below):\n```interface IFooSerialized {\n    nameSomethingElse: string;\n}\nclass Foo {\n  name: string;\n  GetName(): string { return this.name }\n  toJSON(): IFooSerialized {\n      return {\n          nameSomethingElse: this.name\n      };\n  }\n  fromJSON(obj: IFooSerialized) {\n        this.name = obj.nameSomethingElse;\n  }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var foo1 = new Foo();\nfoo1.name = \"John Doe\";\nvar json = JSON.stringify(foo1);\njson === '{\"nameSomethingElse\":\"John Doe\"}';\nvar foo2 = SerializationHelper.toInstance(new Foo(), json);\nfoo2.GetName() === \"John Doe\";\n```\n\n### Solution 2: Base Class\nAnother way you could do this is by creating your own base class:\n```class Serializable {\n    fillFromJSON(json: string) {\n        var jsonObj = JSON.parse(json);\n        for (var propName in jsonObj) {\n            this[propName] = jsonObj[propName]\n        }\n    }\n}\nclass Foo extends Serializable {\n    name: string;\n    GetName(): string { return this.name }\n}\n```\nThen use it:\n```var foo = new Foo();\nfoo.fillFromJSON(json);\n```\n\nThere are too many different ways to implement a custom deserialization using a base class, and ultimately it depends on how your own choice."}

Look for different types of rocks and pick up interesting ones to look at closely. Take a bag to put interesting things in.\n* Go to a park and play on the swings, slide, and other equipment. Look for interesting trees, plants, and rocks.\n* Go to a local farm and see what's growing. Check out the animals if they have any (chickens, goats, pigs, horses, etc.).\n* Go geocaching with a handheld GPS. It's a high-tech version of a treasure hunt. You can find caches all over the place.\n* Go hiking. Find a local trail and go for a walk.\n* Play in a stream or pond. Look for different types of rocks and minerals. Look for fish and other critters.\n* Build a fort in the woods. Use sticks and leaves to decorate it.\n* Go rock climbing at a local climbing gym. Find a bouldering area if they have one. It's a fun way to climb without the risk of falling very far.\n* Have a picnic lunch in the woods."}

{"prompt":"What if the internet had never been invented? How would that have affected communication and society?","response":"If the internet had never been invented, the world would be a very different place.\nThe most immediate difference would be a much slower pace of technological development. The internet allows ideas to be shared instantly, and for collaboration between individuals who may be thousands of miles apart. It allows companies to outsource work to people all over the world, and for people to find information and learn new things at incredible speeds.\nWithout the internet, all of these things would be much slower. It would take years for a new idea to spread around the world, for example, and companies would have to rely on people local to their business for all of their workforce.\nThe world would also be a much less connected place. It's easy to forget, as the internet has become such a huge part of our lives, that it's really only been around for a couple of decades. Before then, it was still possible to travel and communicate internationally, but it was much more difficult, and as a result, the world was a much bigger place.\nWithout the internet, we would see more regional cultures and identities. In a world where it takes years for new ideas to spread, cultures have a much better chance to grow and flourish independently.\nWe would also see a much bigger difference between rich and poor countries. The internet has allowed developing countries to leapfrog in many areas of technology, for example in the way that many people in Africa have skipped landline phone networks and gone straight to mobile phones. Without the internet, these kinds of leapfrogging effects would be much less common."}
{"prompt":"Why does my recorded voice sound different?","response":"Your recorded voice sounds different than how you hear your own voice because of where the sound travels in both cases.\n\nWhen you hear your voice when you speak, the sound from your vocal folds travels through your body on its way to your ear, including your bones and sinus cavities.\nIn comparison, when you record your voice, the sound travels from your vocal folds to the recorder almost exclusively through the air, thus barely changing resonance.\nThis is why, for instance, your own voice might sound deeper to you than to others perceiving it."}

Considering the fact that elves are immortal, wouldn't their population be the fastest to grow? Also the seem to be perpetually 40 years old, so aren't they eternally fertile as well? Why don't they have more kids and build bigger societies?","response":"Tolkien himself addresses this in an essay called &quot;Laws and Customs Among the Eldar&quot;. There are essentially two problems:\n\n* Elvish libido diminishes over time. Contrary to popular belief (and outward appearance, from a human perspective), Elves do age; and as they get older, they get less interested in procreation.\n* Having children is exhausting. The Elves believe that their child-bearing process draws a heavier physical and spiritual toll on them, compared to what it does to humans. They're understandable reluctant to have a lot of kids, because what's the point in having a dozen kids if doing so might literally kill you?\n\nFrom &quot;Laws and Customs&quot;:\n\nIt might be thought that, since the Eldar do not (as Men deem) grow old in body, they may bring forth children at any time in the ages of their lives. But this is not so. For the Eldar do indeed grow older, even if slowly: the limit of their lives is the life of Arda, which though long beyond the reckoning of Men is not endless, and ages also. Moreover their body and spirit are not separated but coherent. As the weight of the years, with all their changes of desire and thought, gathers upon the spirit of the Eldar, so do the impulses and moods of their bodies change. [...]\nAlso the Eldar say that in the begetting [conceiving], and still more in the bearing of children, greater share and strength of their being, in mind and in body, goes forth than in the making of mortal children. For these reasons it came to pass that the Eldar brought forth few children; and also that their time of generation was in their youth or earlier life, unless strange and hard fates befell them.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n\nThat last point about the toll on their mind and body is worth expanding on, and fortunately Tolkien does this later in the essay:\n\n[A]ll the Eldar, being aware of it in themselves, spoke of the passing of much strength, both of mind and of body, into their children, in bearing and begetting. Therefore they hold that the fëa [soul], though unbegotten, draws nourishment directly from the fëa of the mother while she bears and nourishes the hrondo [body; later changed to the word hroä], and mediately but equally from the father, whose fëa is bound in union with the mother's and supports it.\nHistory of Middle-earth X Morgoth's Ring Part 3: &quot;The Later Quenta Silmarillion&quot; Chapter 2: &quot;The Second Phase&quot; Laws and Customs Among the Eldar\n"}
{"prompt":"What is the difference between minimum and infimum?","response":"The minimum is attained, the infimum isn't necessarily. \nExample.\nLet $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$. Then $f$ has no minimum value on the interval $(0,\\infty)$. The minimum is the smallest element in the set. That is\n$$\n\\min\\{f(x)\\mid x\\in (0,\\infty)\\}\n$$\ndoesn't exist because there is not smallest number in the set.\nAnother example is the minimum of the set $S = (0,1) = \\{x\\mid 0<x<1\\}$. Here again there isn't a smallest number\n$$\n\\min\\{x\\mid 0<x<1\\}\n$$\ndoesn't exist.\nThe infimum of a set $S$ is defined as the greatest number that is less than or equal to all elements of S (from Wikipedia). The infimum is also sometimes called the greatest lower bound.\nIt is a fact that every non empty set (bounded below) of real numbers has an infimum. But, as we saw, not every real set has a minimum.\nSo in the example\n$$\n\\inf\\{f(x)\\mid x\\in (0,\\infty)\\} = 0.\n$$\nNote that the infimum and the minimum can be the same. Consider for example $S = \\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}$. Then the infimum and minimum is both $1$.\nConsider this other example. If $f$ is a continuous function on a closed interval $[a,b]$,  then it is a fact that $f$ attains a minimum over that interval. So here again\n$$\n\\inf\\{f(x)\\mid x\\in [a,b]\\} = \\min\\{f(x)\\mid x\\in [a,b]\\}.\n$$"}
{"prompt":"Layman's explanation of encryption backdoors","response":"There are two somewhat orthogonal concepts in backdooring encryption algorithms:\n\n* The backdoor can be explicit or implicit. An explicit backdoor is one that everybody knows it is there. An implicit backdoor strives at remaining undetected by the algorithm owners. Of course, when there is an explicit backdoor, people tend to avoid the algorithm altogether, so explicit backdoors may hope to work only in the presence of a legal framework that forces implementers to use the backdoored system.\nAn example of an explicit backdoor is the Clipper chip (which was ultimately abandoned). The backdoor is not really in the algorithm, more in the assembly of algorithms into a protocol, and technically it was an automatic key escrowing method. For an implicit backdoor, see the Dual EC DRBG as a famous example: it worked only as long as nobody was aware that it was backdoored.\n* The backdoor's security may be quantifiable, or not. In the case of Dual EC DRBG, the mechanism uses well-trodden mathematical paths: the NSA knew that exploiting the backdoor required knowledge of an internal secret key, based on discrete logarithm (on elliptic curves).\nA non-quantifiable security is what happens when you try to push, for instance, a voluntarily flawed algorithm, or one for which you know of a cryptanalytic method that you did not publish. This is a very dangerous game for a spy agency, because you cannot really know whether third parties could find the flaw or not. Such backdooring tends to backfire in the long term.\nInterestingly, the NSA tends not to use non-quantifiable backdoors. A good example is DES. At the time it was designed, the NSA believed that it could tackle an upfront 256 exhaustive search, and that nobody else (in particular the Soviets) had the technology and budget for that. The NSA also knew of a novel cryptanalytic method (differential cryptanalysis). So when the NSA intervened in the design of DES, it insisted on shortening the key from 64 to 56 bits (that's addition of a quantifiable backdoor, and it was rather obvious, so quasi-explicit), and also on strengthening the design against differential cryptanalysis. This is a good example about how NSA consciously refrained from a non-quantifiable backdoor. There is only one thing that spy agencies fear more than not being able to spy: it is the idea that other competing spy agencies may also spy.\n\nSo a real, good backdoor is one that uses maths to offer quantifiable security against unauthorized usage of the backdoor. It is extremely difficult to have quantifiable security without making the backdoor explicit. The \"best in class\" in that area is Dual EC DRBG, and even before the Snowden business, cryptographers were already finding it weird and strongly suspected foul play (see the analyses back in 2007, 6 years before Snowden)."}

{"prompt":"Você encontra na internet a afirmação que Singletons são ruins. Isto é verdade? Por quê?\nO problema seria generalizado para quaisquer objetos com instância única? Ou para qualquer coisa que tenha estado global?\nSe é tão ruim, pra que foi inventado? Ou seja, que problema ele queria resolver?\nQuais os problemas que terei se usá-lo?\nExiste alternativa viável?","response":"Muito da polêmica ocorre pela falta de uma contextualização. Não vejo nada que desabone o padrão Sigleton quando usado no contexto correto. Sim, ele pode causar muito mal, assim como qualquer padrão de projeto aplicado indevidamente sem análise do impacto e dos efeitos colaterais.\n\n###Porque não usar\n* Acoplamento. Ao usar um Singleton você está acoplando o código a uma implementação estática e específica. Isso torna o seu código dependente dessa classe e impede, por exemplo, criar mocks em testes unitários. Desse ponto de vista a consequência é basicamente a mesma de fazer diretamente um ```new MeuObjetoImportante()```, pois é uma dependência direta da classe.\n* Escopo. O padrão Singleton aplicado conforme a definição também elimina o conceito de escopo. Isso significa que se você por alguma razão decidir que para determinados componentes da aplicação você precisa de outra implementação terá que alterar manualmente todas as classes.\n* Não garantia de uma instância única. Em certos casos o padrão pode levar à falsa segurança de que existirá apenas uma instância. Vamos supor que você projete um sistema web e quer dar acesso a um arquivo ou recurso exclusivo. Um Singleton parece uma boa prática, não é? Mas e se amanhã você fizer o deploy da aplicação em um cluster com N servidores.\n\nNo caso de Java isso também é bem complicado, pois não existe isso de uma classe por JVM. O conceito correto é uma classe por ```ClassLoader```, de forma que num mesmo servidor JEE duas aplicações diferentes podem ter, cada uma, sua própria versão de uma mesma classe. As variáveis estáticas não são compartilhadas entre essas versões da mesma classe, portanto o escopo do Singleton em Java é por ```ClassLoader``` e não por programa.\n\n###Porque usar\nEm algumas situações você sabe que vai ter só uma instância da classe. Em uma aplicação Desktop, por exemplo, não há porque ter \"frescuras\" adicionais para obter uma conexão com o banco de dados. \nTambém não vejo problemas em um objeto encapsulando alguns atributos de configuração globais. Simplesmente não valeria o esforço de implementar algum mecanismo muito elaborado para algo tão simples.\n\n###Como usar\nQuando pensamos em Singleton, logo a implementação clássica do Gang of Four nos vêm à mente. Os tópicos anteriores desta resposta consideraram isso. Porém, com a ascensão do uso de frameworks de Inversão de Controle (IoC) e Injeção de Dependência (DI), existe hoje uma forma muito mais \"segura\" e flexível de implementar o padrão: deixe o framework cuidar disso para você!\n\n###Como evitar o Singleton\nApesar de implementações mais simples poderem usar o padrão Singleton da forma \"clássica\" sem problemas, em geral seria melhor aplicar a Inversão de Controle simplesmente deixar a instância de suas dependências serem injetadas. Dessa forma, caso amanhã os requisitos mudem e você preciso injetar diferentes instâncias, ou mesmo queira criar mocks de teste, basta configurar seu container ou framework para tal, sem alterar as implementações existentes."}

{"prompt":"I believe artificial intelligence (AI) term is overused nowadays.

Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\nArtificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig\n\nSo the example you cite, \"autopilot for cars\/planes\", is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found. They do this with autopilot for cars all the time\n\nTo answer your question, for something to be considered as \"having AI\", it needs to be able to deal with unknown environments\/circumstances in order to achieve its objective\/goal, and render knowledge in a manner that provides for new learning\/information to be added easily. There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular neural net, through to probabilistic models like bayesian networks (belief networks) - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI."}
{"prompt":"Would a bullet made from ice be capable of killing somebody at 100 metres before melting?","response":"The short answer is probably no.\nIt would either shatter because of the amount of force the weapon puts on it or melt because of the heat (in case of a regular combustion gun). The former has more chance of happening, before the ice even has the time to start melting.\nThe only way to shoot it without shattering it nor melting it, at least using weapons available to us, would be to use compressed air weapons, but it would need to be significantly powered down to prevent the bullet from shattering, so it would probably not be powerful enough to cause damage.\nThe force needed to break through one square inch of ice is roughly 400 pounds on average. The bullet you're trying to fire is probably 9mm, but let's just calculate as though it was about one square inch (although it's actually quite smaller than that): those 400 pounds equal roughly 1800N.\nThe force that comes out of a 9mm gun is approximately 383 ft-lbs, which equals to 520 newtons per metre. That amount is about 52000N per centimetre. One inch is about 2 and a half centimeters, so that means it's more about 20'800N per inch. As you can see, it's a lot more than what it takes to break ice.\nAs for the \"wall\" towards which something has to be pushed in order to break it, the air will fulfill the role: the atmospheric pressure is about 15 pounds per square inch: it doesn't seem like a lot, but in the time it takes the bullet to win this force and gain momentum, it gets shattered by the enormous amount of energy produced by the weapon."}

However, it's not recommended, and it's much better and flexible to use ```?=``` assignment (the conditional variable assignment operator, it only has an effect if the variable is not yet defined):\n```FOO?=default_value_if_not_set_in_environment\n```\nNote that certain variables are not inherited from environment:\n\n* ```MAKE``` is gotten from name of the script\n* ```SHELL``` is either set within a makefile, or defaults to ```\/bin\/sh``` (rationale: commands are specified within the makefile, and they're shell-specific).\n\n* From command line - ```make``` can take variable assignments as part of his command line, mingled with targets:\n```make target FOO=bar\n```\nBut then all assignments to ```FOO``` variable within the makefile will be ignored unless you use the ```override``` directive in assignment. (The effect is the same as with ```-e``` option for environment variables).\n* Exporting from the parent Make - if you call Make from a Makefile, you usually shouldn't explicitly write variable assignments like this:\n```# Don't do this!\ntarget:\n        $(MAKE) -C target CC=$(CC) CFLAGS=$(CFLAGS)\n```\nInstead, better solution might be to export these variables.  Exporting a variable makes it into the environment of every shell invocation, and Make calls from these commands pick these environment variable as specified above.\n```# Do like this\nCFLAGS=-g\nexport CFLAGS\ntarget:\n        $(MAKE) -C target\n```\nYou can also export all variables by using ```export``` without arguments."}
{"prompt":"What is the best argument for a socialist society?","response":"There are different forms of socialism, and many arguments to be made for or against each one. Here are some of the most common arguments for socialist policies:\n* Reduction of Relative Poverty: A welfare state which provides a minimum basic income for those who are unemployed, sick, or unable to work maintains a basic living standard for the poorest in society and helps to reduce relative poverty.\n* Free Health Care: Free health care at the point of use means everyone is entitled to basic health care. \n* Environment: An economy which is regulated to work towards the long-term welfare will place a higher value on environmental concerns, such as limiting pollution - even if it lowers profit.\n* Benefits of Public Ownership: Public ownership of water and the railways allows the companies to target goals such as long-term investment, low prices for the consumer and improved safety.\n* Free Education: Education is a major means for socio-economic mobility. Providing all citizens access to high-quality, free education allows for more equal opportunities for underprivileged individuals.\n\nHaving said that, there are also arguments against socialism and specific socialist policies. When contemplating any policy or ideology, it is important to considering its strengths, weaknesses, and applicability to the situation at hand."}
{"prompt":"I need a gift for my daughter's 13th birthday. She loves photography.","response":"Here are a few gift ideas for a 13 year-old girl who loves photography:\n\n* Camera: Even though modern phones have very good cameras, you could consider a more professional camera, such as a mirrorless camera.\n* Lens Kit: If your daughter already owns a good camera, you may want to get her a new lens kit that would allow her to take specialized photos, such as a portrait or macro lens.\n* Accessories: Alternatively, you could look into tripods, camera bags, flashes, and other camera accessories.\n* Courses: Another option is to enroll her in an afterschool photography class, where she can hone her photography skills and meet other photography enthusiasts her age.\n* Trip: Finally, you could check out the option of taking your daughter on a special photography trip. Not only would she have plenty of opportunity to capture stunning photos, it would also give you an amazing opportunity to bond with your child through their hobby."}
{"prompt":"Normal filesystem images can be easily mounted:\n```mount system.img \/mnt\n```\nExamined, and modified.  But when I try this with a Raspberry Pi system image (e.g. raspbian), I get:\n```mount: unknown filesystem type '(null)'\n```\nAnd no matter what I try with ```-t```, it won't work.  How can I mount this image?","response":"You can't mount the image as a whole because it actually contains two partitions and a boot sector.  However, you can mount the individual partitions in the image if you know their offset inside the file.  To find them, examine the image as a block device with ```fdisk -l whatever.img```.  The output should include a table like this:\n```Device         Boot     Start       End  Blocks  Id System\nwhatever.img1            8192    122879   57344   c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\nwhatever.img2          122880   5785599 2831360  83 Linux\n```\nThese are the two partitions.  The first one is labelled \"FAT32\", and the other one \"Linux\". Above this table, there's some other information about the device as a whole, including:\n```Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\n```\nWe can find the offset in bytes by multiplying this unit size by the ```Start``` block of the partition:\n\n* 1st partition 512 * 8192 = 4194304\n* 2nd partition 512 * 122880 = 62914560\n\nThese can be used with the ```offset``` option of the ```mount``` command.  We also have a clue about the type of each partition from ```fdisk```.  So, presuming we have directories ```\/mnt\/img\/one``` and ```\/mnt\/img\/two``` available as mount points:\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304 -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\nmount -v -o offset=62914560 -t ext4 whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/two\n```\nIf you get an \"overlapping loop\" error here, your version of ```mount``` requires you to specify the size as well as the offset of the first partition.  Unmount that, and use the number of blocks (57344) * 512 (= 29360128):\n```mount -v -o offset=4194304,sizelimit=29360128 \\\n    -t vfat whatever.img \/mnt\/img\/one\n```\nThe second partition doesn't need a sizelimit since there's nothing after it in the image.    \nYou can now access the two partitions.  If you do not intend to change anything in them, use the ```-r``` (read-only) switch too.  If you do change anything, those changes will be included in the ```.img``` file.\nNote that the first partition is probably mounted on ```\/boot``` in the second partition when the system is running."}
{"prompt":"How can horns, most of which have only three buttons, play all their notes?","response":"Put as simply as possible, horns are tubes. Blowing in special ways makes certain notes sound from those tubes. By changing one's embouchure, those notes start at a fundamental, then gradually go up in harmonics. The first notes (in key C) would be C, G, C, E, G.Those notes are the ones we hear when a bugle is played - Reveille, Last Post, etc. Bugles only play the harmonic series of notes, and can't play the ones in between. Read on.\nOn a trumpet, for starters, there are three valves. One drops any open note played by one semitone, another by two semitones, and the other by three semitones. So using a combination of valves, you can lower any open note by up to six semitones.\nLet's take the first G note. To get F♯, press the semitone valve. To get F, press the tone valve. To get E, press two valves to drop a tone and a half. (there's one valve alone that can do this). To play E♭, press the two valves that drop two tones. To get D, press the two valves to drop two and a half tones. And to get C♯, press all three.\nThat's the more complicated bit, as between the open notes, there's more semitones than anywhere else further up in pitch. Notice that between G and the next C, there are only two tones.\nSo at this point, not so many notes are needed, so the valve pressing is more simple. Next, between that C and the E, there's even fewer, so again, not so many valve changes are needed.\nNow, onto trombone. There are actually valve trombones, which work the same as trumpets, etc., but for the standard trombone, imagine those extra lengths of tube brought into play by pressing valves are now a single continuum of tubing, operated by the slide. At various places along that slide, there are all the notes found similarly to pressing valves. There's also loads of extra notes that are going to be out of tune!"}
{"prompt":"The following article from CNN describes a Michigan police officer being put on administrative leave for having KKK material at his home: https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2019\/08\/10\/us\/michigan-officer-placed-on-leave-kkk-document-house\/index.html. The materials were discovered while a potential buyer was touring his house. \nAlthough I vehemently condemn the KKK, doesn't this officer have the right to display whatever he wants in his home so long as it doesn't actively and deliberately call for violence? Aren't these articles protected under the first amendment? I realize this is an extreme example, and as a police officer his job requires interacting with all races, but unless it can be shown that he's bigoted and that it negatively affected his job performance, isn't it illegal to fire him? \nEmployers can restrict speech according to company policy while at work, but we all have to go home at some point. Can those restrictions follow us after clocking out? ","response":"In general, employers in the United States are free to fire you for your speech. The First Amendment does not apply to anyone except the government (other than a narrow set of circumstances where private parties act on behalf of the government or take on government roles, like when private universities employ campus police). If the officer was being fired from a job at a private company, this would not be an interesting question -- the answer would clearly be \"no, there is no First Amendment claim here.\" That’s not to say labor laws might not come into play (for instance, federal law prohibits firing an employee for organizing a union, and some states prohibit firing for off-duty political speech); however, labor law protections exist by statute and are not derived from the First Amendment.\nWhat makes this interesting is that the government is involved. Unlike private employers, government agencies are bound by the First Amendment. In Pickering v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court held that this does restrict them in their role as employer and that they can't necessarily fire an employee for speech. Pickering imposes a balancing test, where the harm to the employee's First Amendment rights is weighed against the government's interest in efficient operation. Courts have given particular leeway to police departments punishing speech that would undermine public trust and confidence in the department. A police officer expressing racist views, even privately, can seriously hamper the effectiveness of the department if the speech gets linked back to them. For instance, see Pappas v. Giuliani, where the Second Circuit upheld the firing of an NYPD officer for anonymously mailing racist diatribes from home in his off-duty time.\nAnother answer suggests that the main question is a public safety one: whether the officer could be trusted to carry out his duties without bias. But that's not the only legitimate consideration for the government employer. The courts have repeatedly held that public perception of an agency is a legitimate concern, especially when it comes to agencies (like the police) whose job requires maintaining good relations with the community. In Pappas, the officer was assigned as a computer operator who had no contact with the public, but he was still a police officer whose speech had a high potential to undermine NYPD community relations."}
{"prompt":"How do DOS games like DOOM benefit from a PCI graphics card?","response":"DOOM itself doesn’t do anything special to benefit from PCI graphics cards. It runs faster with PCI graphics cards (and VLB, AGP, and PCI Express cards) than with ISA graphics cards because the supporting bus is faster, so reads from and writes to video memory take less time.\nPCI goes to great lengths to preserve backwards compatibility with ISA-based VGA, providing support for “VGA compatible” adapters so that they can appear in memory at the same locations and use the same I\/O ports as ISA VGA cards. So accesses to the VGA registers and to the VGA buffer (at 0xA0000) go directly to the main PCI VGA compatible adapter in the system, with no change required in the operating system or programs running on it. (This is the reason why there’s a specific “VGA compatible controller” device type in PCI. Such shenanigans are impossible for other device types in PCI, which is why PCI sound cards have so much trouble providing compatibility with programs written for ISA sound cards.)\nA faster bus and\/or faster video memory immediately leads to higher performance in video-intensive programs because software doesn’t need to be careful about how it accesses video memory (except on CGA, and on all platforms with vertical blank synchronisation if it cares about tearing). So ```REP MOVSW``` or ```REP MOVSD``` with no waiting in software, once the program decides to write a frame, is perfectly fine, and will go faster and faster as the underlying hardware improves. On platforms where this can’t work in hardware (e.g. on an 8088 with a VGA card), the hardware takes care of specifics — for example on an 8088 the bus unit will split up 16-bit accesses.\nYour question is specific to DOOM but other DOS games are in a similar situation. Later games tended to rely on VBE (often using UniVBE) to access video modes beyond those provided by VGA, but they mostly didn’t use anything beyond video-mode setup and framebuffer configuration (see also Were any DOS games (or software) known to use VBE\/AF?), so improved video speed came mostly from bus speed increases, faster video memory, and speed increases in the cards themselves (which was already a factor in the ISA era, compare most Trident cards to Tseng cards for example).\nFor an excellent explanation of the intricacies of VGA programming and its memory layout, see Fabien Sanglard’s Game Engine Black Book series. The DOOM update loop is shown on page 185 of the DOOM book; it doesn’t use any assembly language (unlike the renderer, see pp. 290 and following), but it does have one perhaps surprising feature given the 32-bit nature of the code: VGA updates are done 16 bits at a time. Section 2.3 of the same book, pp. 59 and following, describes some of the improvements to VGA adapters around the time DOOM was released, in particular the switch to the VESA Local Bus on 486s. The benchmark table on page 287 shows the importance of the bus."}
{"prompt":"So whenever we want to shoot our flash before taking a photo. we have to charge it first.\nWhat is the point of the charging our flashes? Aren't their power directly supplied by the battery of our camera?\nPlease answer for the built in flash on the 2000D and the traditional hot shoe Xenon flashes.\nPerhaps these hot shoe xenon flashes have their own batteries charged by the slow hot shoe port. Who knows? ","response":"The peak power at work when a flash is being discharged is extreme.\nExample: a classic Metz 45CT (a large but still handheld unit) on full manual power delivers around 90 watt-seconds of electrical output to the flash tube in 1\/300s. That means there are 27000 watts at work for a short time.\nA 27000 watt lightbulb (BTW, your flash is much brighter than that - more efficient!) would need the ampacity of around eight european household sockets (230V, fused at 13 or 16 amps) to operate, since it would draw around 120 ampere from them. At the voltage levels xenon flash tubes typically operate at, around 80 amperes will flow; if you wanted to pull that energy \"live\" from a 5-6V battery, you'd need to pull around 5000 amperes AND instantaneously convert them to around 80 amperes at high voltage. Batteries that could deliver 5000 amps - while not wasting most of the power as heat generated across their internal resistance - for a short duration and live certainly exist - you are looking at starter batteries for big lorries, which are rather inconvenient to lug around. Also, a 5000 ampere current pulse is quite a magnetic nuisance if there is anything either ferromagnetic or intended as an electrical conductor near the conductors used.\nYour average \"big\" speedlite, btw, will be around half the power described here (but might in some cases reach the same or higher peak currents in order to discharge even faster), an in-camera flash will be a fraction of these numbers - but still inconvenient to build any other way.\nIf you need a short, massive current pulse, the best energy source available in engineering is a previously charged capacitor (metal-paper or electrolytic type, not dual-layer \"supercap\"). This energy storage device is large for its storage capacity if you compare it to a battery - but able to respond far quicker to high current demand, since a) there is no chemical energy conversion involved in its operation, b) the relevant current path only involves metallic, very conductive parts instead of ionic conductors (aka electrolytes. An electrolytic capacitor, btw, does use its electrolyte for chemical self-upkeep, not for chemical energy storage or electrical connectivity). \nAlso, since the charge in a a capacitor is limited, it allows portioning total energy to what the flashlamp can safely take. This allows a flash in manual mode to just completely discharge the capacitor until it is nearly empty (when the remaining charge can only deliver voltage below the quench voltage of the flashlamp) without complex control circuitry - and at the same time gives you a safety fallback when working with dynamically controlled power levels (telecomputer or TTL mode), leaving no way for catastrophic circuit failure in combination with several kilowatts of constant power available turning into a massive safety hazard. A handheld-sized efficient electrical near point light source with 27000W input, driven constantly, would first severely damage your eyes and then self destroy violently (think of a welding arc - dangerously bright, and it melts metal)."}

{"prompt":"How to identify different types of forklifts?","response":"Whether you're new to forklifts, or an experienced operator, it is always important to know as much as you can about forklifts and their operation. It is equally important to be able to identify different forklifts, both by look and name. This is especially important when searching for forklift operating jobs, as it will allow you to know which type of forklift you will be operating and if you have the experience to do so.\n\n## Identify basic \"forklifts\" and jack\n\n1. Know what manual pallet jacks are. Although not usually considered a forklift, pallet jacks are some of the most common manual forms of pallet handling that people will come across in logistics industries. Manual pallet jacks are usually very simple in design; the handle lever is squeezed to lower the pallet jack forks for insertion into a pallet, and the handle lever is moved in the opposite direction to engage the hydraulics that allows the pallet to be raised by pumping the handle.\n2. Familiarize yourself with motorized pallet jacks. Motorized pallet jacks, on the other hand, are much more varied than manual pallet jacks. They are almost always powered by electric batteries. Some are walk-behind, some are ride-on, and some even require the operator to take a side stance to ride on\/operate, which is considerably more difficult to learn. Motorized pallet jacks usually have extended pallet forks that are used to handle two pallets at a time for greater efficiency in large warehouse operations, such as order picking. However, single pallet handlers are more common in smaller warehouses, for greater maneuverability and ease of use.\n3. Learn to recognize walkie stackers. Walkie stackers, also known as pedestrian forklifts, are still usually not considered a true forklift. However, they very closely resemble a forklift with forks, a mast, backrest, etc. They are almost always operated with a walk-behind pedestrian operator. They are frequently used in retail, very small storerooms, small scale warehousing, etc.\n\n\n## Identify counterbalance forklifts\n\n1. Know what standard counterbalance forklifts are. Being the most iconic, recognized, and popular type of forklift, a standard counterbalance forklift is a forklift where the driver sits facing the forks, and the counterweight is everything behind the front wheels of the forklift.\n2. Consider how different standard counterbalance forklifts are powered. These forklifts can be powered by anything, from batteries, petrol (gasoline), diesel, LPG\/propane gas bottles, and other forms of fuel, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, internal combustion forklifts (petrol, LPG, diesel, etc) are generally faster and have greater lifting capacities than electric\/battery-powered forklifts. However, for health and safety reasons, combustion forklifts cannot be used in confined spaces (e.g. shipping containers, small warehouses, etc) due to the exhaust gasses produced when in operation.\n3. Be familiar with how many wheels standard counterbalance forklifts have. They can be either 4-wheeled or 3-wheeled; two wheels at the front and one at the back allows for greater maneuverability, at the expense of stability. This is why 4-wheeled forklifts are usually more common, as they generally still have more than enough maneuverability for most applications in small spaces.\n\n\n## Identify warehouse forklifts\n\n1. Get to know reach forklifts. Designed for usage for indoors and on flat surfaces, reach forklifts (also known as high-reach forklifts) are named for their ability to reach high racking. (up to 12 metres (39ft) or more!!!) Depending on the forklift manufacturer, the reaching mechanism may be a moving mast type, or a moving forks and carriage type. Reach forklifts generally have lifting capacities of 1 ton to 2.5 tons. Lifting capacities above 2.5 ton are generally very rare due to many factors such as narrow aisle space and keeping the forklift compact (a stronger forklift must be larger and therefore unable to operate in narrow aisles) and also generally due to most loads in warehousing to be put in aisle racking usually just do not weigh more than 1- 2 tons. Reach forklifts drive differently, compared to counterbalance forklifts because the operator sits (or stands, depending on the model) sideways on the forklift. Reach forklifts are designed for narrow warehouse aisle use; the operator is able to look forward or backward without the neck strain of having to turn around. This sideways operator position, alongside with reversed steering controls, makes reach forklifts considerably challenging for a new operator to learn.\n2. Know what double deep reach forklifts are. Double deep reach forklifts are very similar to reach forklifts. However, as the name suggests, they are able to retrieve\/put away pallets that are stored in double deep racking, which are pallets that are stored one in front of each other in specially designed racks.\n3. Familiarize yourself with order picker forklifts. Although an order picker forklift is considered a type of forklift, it is not used for regular forklift operations. Order picker forklifts require the operator to wear a harness and stand while operating, as they are used for lifting pallets alongside with the operator up into the air. The operator then typically picks up individual units of a product to manually stack on a pallet to \"pick\" an warehouse order; this is opposed to regular order picking, where workers can only pick products from ground level. An order picker forklift can allow operators to pick products quickly and efficiently at any level in the air.\n4. Recognize the disadvantages of picker forklifts. The only main disadvantage of them is that they must be operated on flat ground, and they cannot be operated on slopes or uneven ground; they are top heavy, and this increases the risk of tip overs.\n\n\n## Identify big forklifts\n\n1. Know what a heavy duty forklift is. A heavy duty forklift is an umbrella term used to describe a counterbalance forklift with a high lifting capacity. Most standard counterbalance forklifts in warehouses and manufacturing plants will only have a lifting capacity of 1-3 tons, whereas heavy duty forklifts have a lifting capacity of 5 - 50+ tons!\n2. Understand how heavy duty forklifts operate. All heavy duty forklifts will require significant space to be able to maneuver around. The higher the lifting capacity the forklift has, the larger the rear end (counterweight) of the forklift will need to be. The vast majority of heavy duty forklifts will be powered by diesel fuel, though some lower end heavy duty forklifts (with lifting capacities up to 8-10 tons) may still be powered by LPG\/propane gas bottles or petrol fuel.While It is generally very uncommon to encounter battery powered heavy duty forklifts, a few forklift companies have recently started to offer them up to the 20 ton range.\n3. Learn about container handling forklifts. Container handling forklifts generally come in two types: Laden and Unladen (i.e. for handling full or empty containers, respectively). Laden container handling forklifts are usually capable of stacking full shipping containers 4-5 high, with lifting capacities ranging from 35-50 tons. Unladen container handling forklifts are able to stack as high as 8 or 9 shipping containers high, but with a lifting capacity of only 7-10 tons (empty shipping containers generally only weigh 3-5 tons). For these reasons, an unladen container handling forklift cannot be used for handling laden shipping containers, as it will be extremely overloaded. (full shipping containers can weigh anywhere from 10-30 tons).\n4. Learn about reach stackers. Reach stackers are technically not forklifts at all; as they do not have a mast or forks to lift loads, instead, they operate with a heavy duty boom that extends from the rear to the front of the reach stacker, and they lift shipping containers using a container handling attachment. Reach stackers often are highly sophisticated machines with on-board computers and other technologies. Their load capacity usually ranges from 40-50 tons. However, due to the extending boom feature, overloading is still possible.\n\n\n## Identify specialist forklifts\n\n1. Learn about Articulated VNA Forklifts. Pictured here, Articulated VNA (Very Narrow Aisle) Forklifts are generally known as \"Bendi\" or \"Flexi\" Forklifts. Articulated Forklifts are special types of forklifts which are articulated from the front end (wheels, mast, and forks and carriage) so that they are able to perform both duties of a counterbalance forklift (loading trucks) and a reach forklift (retrieve\/put away stock in narrow aisles). Another variation of the articulated forklift is the \"Turret truck\" also known as the \"Man-up forklift\", named so, as much like an order picker forklift, turret truck forklifts lift the operator high up in the air along with the forks. Much like \"bendi\" articulated forklifts, turret trucks allow for maximized warehouse storage space by greatly reducing the aisle widths - however unlike bendi forklifts, turret trucks cannot be operated outside, on slopes or on uneven ground, similar as order picking forklifts.\n2. Identify an all terrain forklift. Generally similar in operation to standard counterbalance forklifts, the main difference is All terrain forklifts usually have large trodden tires, for use on all terrain ground, dirt, mud, grass, etc, where regular solid forklift tires would simply not operate on the ground - they would have no traction and get \"bogged\". All terrain forklifts are generally best identified by the large trodden tires and a similar appearance to a small tractor.\n3. Learn about side loaders. A side loader, or multi-directional forklift, is a specialist type of forklift used mainly for the moving of long shaped loads, such as timber, piping, etc. Its main feature is it is able to be driven in different directions; for example, it can be driven sideways after retrieving a long load from an aisle - which greatly eases the process of getting long loads in and out of racking storage - as opposed to turning a full 90 degrees with standard forklifts, a maneuvering problem exacerbated by long shaped loads.\n4. Learn about telehandler forklifts. Similar in design to reach stackers, telehandler forklifts are a specialist type of forklift common in the construction industry, the use of a boom with the forks and carriage on the end allows the handling of loads to places standard mast type forklifts cannot reach, for example on a rooftop, in the middle of a large trailer, etc. Again with the boom extension care needs to be taken as lifting capacity can be significantly reduced.\n5. Understand truck mounted forklifts. Truck mounted forklifts, also known as \"donkey forklifts\", are just as their name suggests. They are a small type of forklift that can be easily mounted on the back of a truck for transport, and easily taken off for use of loading or unloading the trucks on-site. These forklifts are generally built to be lightweight and very simple to operate, thus lifting capacities and lift heights are generally very low. Essentially they are used for lifting small loads on and off trucks, unless they are otherwise specially designed to perform other functions.\n"}

{"prompt":"Assume an environment with a puppet-managed cluster of different servers - various hardware, software, operating systems, virtual\/dedicated, etc.\nWould you choose meaningful hostnames (mysqlmaster01..99, mysqlslave001..999, vpnprimary, vpnbackup, etc.) or would you prefer meaningless hostnames such as characters from a book or movie?\nThe problem I see with meaningful hostnames is that names usually represent a single service and if a server has more than one purpose it gets really messy (especially if server roles change often).\nIsn't mapping a service name to an IP address and maintaining that mapping what DNS is supposed to do?\nWhat are the advantages and drawbacks of both approaches and what actual problems have you had to tackle with the approach you chose?","response":"This largely comes down to whether your servers are ```pets``` or ```livestock```.\n\nPets get individual names. They're distinct from each other, and we care about those differences. When one gets sick, we usually try to nurse it back to health. Traditionally, servers have been pets.\n\nLivestock get numbers. They're mostly identical, and what differences there are, we don't care about and usually try to minimize. When one gets sick, we put it down and get another one. Fully virtualized servers, especially IaaS servers such as AWS, are livestock.\n\nIn most complex environments, you have a mix. Your web backends, for instance, are almost certainly livestock. If you need more, you spin up a few more with the standard config; if you don't need as many you turn some off. Your database servers, in some configurations, are pets. There may be a lot of special setup on each; you may even be running them on bare metal instead of virtualization.\n\nOf course, in either environment, you can name SERVICES and address those directly. This is a best practice in any case; your developers shouldn't need to know or care what the actual hostname of a service is. The hostname should be a purely operational detail. Think, then, of encoding information that is useful to your ops staff in the hostnames - for instance, it's often helpful to denote which datacenter a server is in."}
{"prompt":"I see a low use of Mathematica in Kaggle competitions. Why would one use the Wolfram Language versus R, Python, or Julia for machine learning? Besides prettier plots and the Manipulate function, do we have something that is useful for ML that other languages are lacking?","response":"Mathematica doesn't have the depth of algorithm support that is present in R or Python. Julia has much more limited algorithm support but does exhibit a good turn of speed.\nThe few algorithms that Mathematica does support are not particularly well exposed for the type of tweaking needed to win Kaggle competitions.\nMathematica, as of version 10, supports the following classifiers:  \"LogisticRegression\", \"Markov\", \"NaiveBayes\", \"NearestNeighbors\", \"NeuralNetwork\", \"RandomForest\", \"SupportVectorMachine\".  \nWhilst it does offer one ensemble method, RandomForest, it lacks both Bagging and any flavour of boosting, such as Adaboost. These latter general ensemble methods allow you to leverage the power of a base classifier, either built-in or, of greater utility when exploring performance improvements, of your own design. This limits significantly the potential for creating novel methods within the existing machine learning framework. \nMathematica's strengths lay with it's expressive, compact, language, strong visualisation capabilities and easy parallelization. These make it very efficient to explore new strategies and combinations of ML algorithms you may already have implemented.\nA less often mentioned benefit is that use of Mathematica in a functional programming style tends to lead to fewer bugs in the final code."}
{"prompt":"How to survive an earthquake?","response":"## Take cover indoors\n\n1. Get away from glass, large furniture, and other hazards, if possible. In the first few seconds after the shaking starts, try to quickly move away from anything that could fall and injure you. Get low and walk or crawl away from hazards such as windows, cabinets, televisions, and bookcases. If you're in a crowded public place, such as a store, do not rush toward the exits, even if you see lots of people doing so. Get away from display racks, glass, and exterior walls, and find a covered spot to take shelter. Remember the phrase “Drop, Cover, Hold on,” which is the course of action recommended by U.S. and international emergency management organizations.\n2. Drop to your hands and knees under a sturdy table or desk. Look for a sturdy piece of furniture, such as a solid table, that can offer cover from falling objects. Get down on your hands and knees, and crouch under the desk or table until the shaking stops. If you're in bed during an earthquake, stay there. Brace yourself, and protect your head and neck with a pillow. If you can't get under a sturdy table or desk, take cover in an interior corner of the building. Don't stand in a doorway. This is was recommended in the past, but you're safer under a sturdy table or crouched in a corner. A doorway doesn't offer much protection from falling or flying objects, which cause the most earthquake-related injuries and deaths.\n3. Protect your head and neck from falling debris. If possible, grab a pillow, sofa cushion, or another object to shield your face and head. If there's nothing nearby to use as a shield, cover your face, head, and neck with your hands and arms. A strong earthquake can kick up clouds of dangerous dust. If this is the case, you should also cover your nose and mouth with a handkerchief or an article of clothing.\n4. Remain in your safe spot until the shaking stops. Stay put until the shaking has stopped for 1 or 2 minutes. Remain on guard when you get up, as aftershocks can occur at any time after an earthquake. In the event of an earthquake, you and your family (or coworkers, if you're at work) should meet in a designated safe location. Create an action plan in advance, and head to the designated meeting place once the shaking has stopped. If an aftershock occurs, drop, cover, and hold on until it stops.\n5. Use caution around debris after leaving your shelter. Watch out for broken glass and rubble. If you're not wearing shoes, tread lightly, and be extremely careful not to injure yourself. Grab a pair of heavy-soled shoes and, if you're wearing light clothing, put on a pair of pants and a long-sleeved shirt. In a strong earthquake, remember to cover your mouth to avoid inhaling dust, especially if you have a history of any respiratory diseases. If you're trapped, don't shout, as you'd risk inhaling dust. Instead, send a text or call emergency services, tap on a hard surface, or, if you have one, blow a whistle to alert first responders of your location.\n6. Check for injuries and render aid, if needed. Call emergency services if you or someone nearby are injured and need medical attention. If you know first aid or CPR, administer emergency care as needed. To perform CPR, place one hand over the center of the person's chest, and hold your other hand over the first. Keep your arms straight as you press directly into their chest at a rate of about 100 beats per minute. Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound. Pack the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth and apply firm pressure. If firm pressure doesn't stop the bleeding, use a belt, article of clothing, or bandages to fashion a tourniquet. Wrap the tourniquet 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) above the wound toward the torso. For a wound on the thigh, wrap the tourniquet above the wound near the groin to limit the amount of blood flowing from the heart. If someone is seriously injured or unconscious, don't move them unless the building is structurally unsound or they're otherwise in immediate danger.\n7. Inspect the building for structural damage and hazards. Check for cracks in the building's structure, fires, the smell of gas, and damaged wires or electrical appliances. If you believe the building is unsound, evacuate immediately. If possible, and if there's no immediate threat that the building will collapse, respond to any utility hazards. If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the main valve outside and call the gas company. Note that a professional will be needed to restore service. Look for signs of electrical damage, including sparks, broken or frayed wires, and burning smells. If possible, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you'd have to step in water to access the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician instead of approaching it yourself. Put out any small fires with a fire extinguisher. If there's a larger fire, call emergency services. Evacuate immediately if there's a fire and you smell gas. Don't drink water from the sink, bathe, or use the toilet until your local authorities have advised that it's safe to do so. Plug the drains in sinks and bathtubs to prevent sewage backflow.\n\n\n## Rid it out in a vehicle\n\n1. Stop in a clear area away from trees, buildings, and other structures. Find an open area and stop your vehicle on the shoulder or side of the road. Get as far away as you can from utility poles, large structures, bridges, and any other potential hazards. Pay attention to surrounding traffic, and stop only when it's safe to do so. Don't stop abruptly, or vehicles to the rear might collide with you.\n2. Set your parking brake and wait until the shaking stops. The car may jiggle violently during an earthquake, but stay put and try to remain calm. You're safer in a car than outside, since vehicles offer protection from debris and falling objects. Turn on your radio, as channels should be broadcasting emergency broadcast information.\n3. Beware of damaged roads, debris, and other hazards when you continue driving. Listen for reports of road closures or hazards on the emergency broadcast. When the shaking stops, resume driving and keep your eye out for damaged roadways, sinkholes, unsound bridges, and any other potential hazards. If a power line has fallen on your vehicle or you're otherwise unable to travel, stay put. Call emergency services, and wait for first responders.\n\n\n## Stay safe outdoors\n\n1. Move away from buildings, street lights, power lines, and bridges. The most dangerous locations during an earthquake are areas immediately around buildings. As soon as the ground begins shaking, try to get as far away as possible from any nearby structures. Stay low to the ground to keep your balance as you get to a safe spot, and keep your eye out for falling debris. Do not seek shelter under a bridge or overpass. Additionally, look out for sinkholes, open faults, or large holes in the ground.\n2. Crouch down low in a wide open area until the shaking stops. Once you've made your way away from nearby structures, get on your hands and knees and cover your head. See if there are any objects nearby to use as a shield, such as a trash can lid. If none are available, cover your head and neck with your hands and arms. Remain crouched low to the ground in a covered position until the shaking stops.\n3. Watch out for hazards as you assess your surroundings. As you venture out after the earthquake, beware of broken glass, rubble, downed power lines, fallen trees, and any other potential hazards. Check yourself and anyone nearby for injuries. If necessary, administer first aid and call emergency services. Stay away from damaged structures and areas immediately around buildings. Remember that aftershocks may occur. If there's an aftershock, weakened buildings, windows, and architectural details can fall to the ground.\n4. Get to higher ground if you're on the shore or near a dam. If a shaking lasts more than 20 seconds, don't wait for an alarm or warning to flee. Get to ground that's at least 100 ft (30 m) above sea level or 2 mi (3.2 km) from the shore. Earthquakes can cause tsunamis, so put distance between yourself and the coast. While a catastrophic failure is unlikely, earthquake damage can cause flooding downstream from a dam. If you live in a flood zone, proceed to higher ground. Check evacuation plans in advance if you live near a dam in an earthquake-prone area.\n\n\n## Prepare for an earthquake\n\n1. Make an emergency supply kit. Keep your supplies in an easily accessible spot, such as a hall closet or garage. Make sure every member of your family knows where your emergency supplies are located. Keep the following items on hand:\n\t* Enough bottled water and non-perishable food to last 3 days. A first aid kit, including gauze, alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, tweezers, ibuprofen or another pain reliever, cotton swabs, anti-diarrhea medication, sanitary napkins, and eyewash. Medications that any members of your family take regularly. A flashlight and extra batteries. Tools, including a screwdriver and adjustable wrench. A whistle, to alert first responders in the event you become trapped. Clothes and blankets. Your pet's food and medication, if you have one.\n2. Create a family survival plan for your home. You and anyone you live with should have a plan to quickly get to safety in the event of an emergency. Instruct every member of your household to drop, cover, and hold on, then to head to a designated meeting location when the shaking stops. Designated spots might be a clearing near your home, a school, community center, or a shelter. Make a plan to reunite ahead of time, as phone service may be limited and should be used only for emergencies. Conduct practice drills every 6 months to ensure you and your loved ones know exactly what to do in the event of an earthquake.\n3. Identify safe spots and hazards in each room of your home. Look for tall cabinets, televisions, dressers, bookcases, hanging plants, and other objects that could fall and cause injury. Go room by room with your family members, and note spots that offer protection and those that are potentially dangerous. For example, if there's a heavy desk in your child's bedroom, tell them to take cover under it. Advise them to stay away from their windows and dresser.\n4. Store dangerous objects in a secure cabinet or on lower shelves. Avoid storing heavy objects high up, and install brackets to secure tall furniture to walls. Keep any dangerous items, such as sharp objects, glass, and flammable or toxic substances in locked or low cabinets. Objects such as knives or corrosive liquids can cause serious injury, especially if they fall from a high storage spot during an earthquake.\n5. Take first-aid and CPR classes to become certified. If someone nearby is hurt in an earthquake, basic knowledge of first aid can be a lifesaver. A CPR certification will prepare you to respond if the worst happens. Look online for nearby classes, or check with a local clinic or Red Cross chapter.\n6. Learn how to shut off the water, the electricity, and the gas. Earthquakes can damage utilities and cause flooding, fires, or explosions. If you're not sure how to shut off your utilities, call your service providers for specific instructions. To shut off electricity, turn off individual circuits or fuses at the main box, then turn off the main circuit or fuse. Your gas main should be near your gas meter, but locations vary. Use an adjustable wrench to turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise. Your water main should be at your water meter by the street or sidewalk, but it may be inside your home. Turn the valve 1\/4 turn clockwise to shut off your water.\n"}
{"prompt":"How to do a deep treatment?","response":"A deep moisturizing treatment, protein treatment, or hair mask, can be store bought or homemade. A deep treatment is a great way to improve dry or damaged hair because it moisturizes and strengthens the hair. Read on to learn how to apply one!\n\n## Basic deep treatment\n\n1. Obtain the deep treatment. You can buy one from a store or make your own see below for recipes in \"Related wikiHows\" that you can make at home.\n2. Wash your hair. The hair should be freshly washed before applying the treatment so it can soak in properly. Don't wait until your hair dries to apply the treatment.\n3. Apply the deep treatment to your whole head of hair. Use a comb or brush to distribute the product.\n4. Put your hair up in a towel turban, shower cap, heating cap, etc. This will keep the deep treatment on your hair, and not on your clothes.\n5. Wait for 15 minutes to an hour. Or you can sleep while wearing the deep treatment.\n6. Take the cap off, rinse your hair, and style as usual.\n7. Enjoy your soft, moisturized hair!\n\n\n## Avocado mask deep treatment\n\n1. Get your ingredients. For your deep conditioning mask, you'll need 1 egg-white, 1 avocado, a tablespoon of olive oil, and a tablespoon of honey. These measurements can be altered depending on how long and thick you hair is.\n2. Mix the ingredients. Using a blender or food processor, add all your ingredients and blend them on high until a creamy consistency has formed. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the ingredients together manually, but it will take a bit more time.\n3. Apply the mixture to your hair. Scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips, and spread it throughout your hair, focusing primarily on the ends of each strand. When you've used all of the mask, you can wrap your hair up in a shower-cap to prevent the mask from rubbing off on your clothes.\n4. Let the mask set. Leave the mask for 20-30 minutes to allow time for it to soak into your hair. You can leave it on for longer if you would like, but make sure that you wait at least 20 minutes.\n5. Rinse out the mask. Remove your shower-cap and run your hair under warm water in the shower. Using just the warm water, wash out all of the remaining mask. If you need to, you can use shampoo, but try to avoid it because it will dry out your hair again. When you're finished washing your hair out, dry your hair with a towel.\n6. Repeat the process. You can apply this mask to your hair 1-2 times a week for the optimal results. Otherwise, apply this avocado mask to your hair whenever it starts to appear dull, frizzy, or is dry and damaged to the touch.\n"}

{"prompt":"How to cook corn?","response":"There are many different yet simple ways to cook corn. Corn on the cob can be boiled, microwaved, grilled, steamed, or baked, while loose kernel corn is usually boiled, steamed, or microwaved. Keep reading to learn more about your preferred cooking method.\n\n## Boiling corn on the cob[1]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil a large stockpot of water. Meanwhile, prepare the corn cobs by removing the husks and silks. The exact amount of water you need will vary depending on how large each ear of corn is. Make sure that you use enough water to completely cover the ears of corn once they are submerged. Note that you can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) salt to the water if desired, but it is not needed. To remove the husks, snap off the stem of the corn with your hands. Pull the stem over the length of the corn to peel off the husks still attached to it. Remove the remaining husks by peeling them off with your fingers. Rinse the husk-free corn cobs under running water. Rub your hands over the corn to loose and free as many of the silky threads you spot clinging to the corn.\n2. Transfer the corn to the boiling water. Cover the pot and let it return to boiling. Use tongs to dunk the corn into the water. Avoid using your hands to transfer the corn since doing so may result in burns. If the boiling slows or stops after you place the corn in the stockpot, allow the water to reach a boiling point again before timing the cooking process.\n3. Cook for 3 to 8 minutes. The corn should be \"tender-crisp\" when done. \"Tender-crisp\" means that the corn is soft enough to press, but not mushy. The precise amount of cooking time will vary based on the type of corn and how mature it is. Fresh corn and sweet corn usually cook fastest.\n4. Remove and serve. Transfer the ears of corn to a layer of clean paper towels and let drain for 30 to 60 seconds before serving. The corn will be hot, so you may want to wait a few minutes before biting into it. Corn is usually served with a drizzle of butter.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn on the cob[2]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Place an ear of corn in a microwave-safe dish. You will need to cook the corn one ear at a time, but the instructions are the same for each ear. Do not remove the husk. The corn will cook better in the microwave if left in the husk during the cooking process.\n2. Microwave the corn for 5 minutes. The microwave should be set on high power or full power. Let stand in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes to avoid burning yourself with the steam.\n3. Transfer the corn to a cutting board. Cut of the stem end using a sharp kitchen knife. Use oven mitts or a towel when removing the corn from the microwave. As you cut, you should also remove the first row of kernels. Make sure to cut through the husk completely.\n4. Slip the corn out of its husk and serve. Use oven mitts or a towel to grab hold of the corn from the uncut top end. Gently shake the ear, allowing the corn to slip free. The ear of corn should slip out of the husk easily. Usually, even the silks will remain left behind inside the husks. You can serve the corn with butter and salt, or however you prefer it.\n\n\n## Grilling corn on the cob\n\n1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn. If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface. Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers. Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.\n2. Brush the corn with olive oil. Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear. You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.\n3. Transfer the corn to the grill. Cook for 6 to 10 minutes. Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning. The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.\n4. Serve as desired. Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands. Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.\n\n\n## Steaming corn on the cob[3]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Boil water in the bottom portion of a steamer. Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait. If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot. Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers. Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.\n2. Transfer the corn to the steaming basket. Cook for 8 to 12 minutes. Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns. The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn. The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.\n3. Serve warm. Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying. Season with butter and salt, if desired.\n\n\n## Baking corn on the cob[4]\n x\n research source\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius). Remove the husks and silks from each ear of corn as the oven preheats. To remove the husk from an ear of corn, snap off the stem using your hands. Pull the broken stem down over the ear, stripping away any husk attached to it. Peel the rest of the exposed husk away with your fingers. Rinse each corn cob under running water, scrubbing gently with your hands to remove any visible silks. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2. Season the ears with butter. You can also add a little salt and pepper, if desired. Use plenty of butter. Spread at least 1 to 2 Tbsp of melted butter over each ear.\n3. Wrap each ear in aluminum foil. Each ear must be completely wrapped inside its own sheet of aluminum foil. If you are worried about butter leaking out from the aluminum foil, place a flat baking sheet or jelly-roll pan beneath the wrapped ears of corn to catch any dripping butter.\n4. Bake the corn for 20 to 30 minutes. Most ears of corn will only take 20 minutes to cook, but larger ears may need as many as 30 minutes. Place the corn on the middle rack of your oven to ensure the most even cooking.\n5. Remove and serve. Let the cooked ears of corn rest for 2 to 5 minutes before carefully removing the aluminum foil. Serve once they are cool enough to touch.\n\n\n## Boiling corn kernels\n\n1. Boil water in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels. You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary. The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use. You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.\n2. Add the corn to the boiling water. If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.\n3. Cover and cook. Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished. Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes. Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.\n4. Serve as desired. Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them. If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.\n\n\n## Steaming corn kernels\n\n1. Simmer water in a steamer. Fill the lower part of a steamer with water and heat, on the stove, over medium heat until the water steams and starts to simmer. Do not boil the water. Do not fill the steamer high enough for water to slip up through the holes of the steamer basket. If you do not have a steamer, you could use a stockpot and a metal colander with fine holes. Make sure that the colander fits over the lip of the stockpot without falling in.\n2. Add frozen corn kernels into the steamer basket. Spread the kernels out into a single layer. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but they will finish cooking in a much shorter amount of time. They may also be soggier once finished. You do not need to thaw frozen corn kernels before use.\n3. Cook for 9 to 10 minutes. Allow the corn to steam for 9 to 10 minutes without covering it. Drain once finished. Canned kernels will only need to steam for 3 or 4 minutes.\n4. Serve. Steamed corn can be served with butter and salt as well as other seasonings.\n\n\n## Microwaving corn kernels\n\n1. Place corn kernels in a microwave-safe dish. Spread frozen corn kernels into an even layer in the dish. Canned corn kernels can also be used, but there are some differences in the cooking method and length. Frozen corn does not need to be thawed prior to cooking.\n2. Add 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 mL) of water. Stir the water into the corn to disperse it throughout. Note that this step is only needed if using frozen corn kernels. You do not need to add water if using canned corn, but you should not drain the canned corn before use.\n3. Cover the dish with plastic wrap. Use a fork to poke a few holes into the plastic wrap, providing ventilation. Only use plastic wrap that is safe to use in the microwave. If the dish has a cover, you could use that instead of the plastic wrap. Make sure that the cover is placed on the dish loosely so that the corn is still ventilated.\n4. Microwave for 4 to 5 minutes. If using canned corn, only microwave the dish for 1 to 2 minutes. The exact length of time varies depending on how much wattage your microwave has. A lower-powered microwave will need longer time, while a higher-powered microwave will need less time. If you hear popping sounds as the corn cooks, stop the microwave early.\n5. Drain and serve. Drain the cooking liquid from the corn and season as desired with butter, salt, and pepper.\n\n\n## Charcoal grilled corn on the cob\n\n1. Cut the tip of each ear of corn off. Soak the corn in the husks in a sink or a big pot in 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) of tap water for about an hour.\n2. While they're soaking, prepare your outdoor charcoal grill. Add enough coals for an hour of cooking.\n3. Place the corn still in the husks on the grill. Cook for about an hour, turning occasionally, allowing the husks to char.\n4. Remove the husks.\n5. Add butter, salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.\n"}

{"prompt":"What is likely to happen when you plug two ends of a network cable to a single switch\/router? Will this create problems on the network, or just be ignored?","response":"It depends on the router\/switch. \nIf it's \"Managed\" - Like decent Netgear, Cisco or HP Procurve, or has STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) or one of its variants enabled, there's a few seconds of absolute insanity, then the switch realises that there's a loop in the network topology, and blocks one of the ports. \n(I've only described the STP re-convergence as \"absolute insanity\" because if you're using old-style, slow, STP then re-convergence can take 30s or more, depending on network complexity.  Vendor specific STP extensions such as BackboneFast and so on will decrease this, but you might still end up with a short period of a slightly unstable network. Rapid STP is a lot quicker to converge, due to a different algorithm)\nIf it's \"Unmanaged\"- Like pretty much all SOHO grade gear, and a fair proportion of small 4-8 port switches, then all hell breaks loose, as you've just created a loop in a network, and all the traffic tends to just bounce about inside the loop.  \nThe reason this happens is because switches rely on a process of MAC address learning to map MAC addresses to physical ports.  In a non-looped network,  one MAC address will only be visible to the switch on a given physical port.  If you have a loop, then the switch will see multiple paths to the same MAC address, and possibly multiple MAC addresses on multiple ports, so instead of the traffic being switched efficiently, it will be broadcast to wherever it sees the MACs.  This is known as a \"Broadcast Storm\".\nThis can quickly use up all of a switch's CPU power, fill the transmit and receive buffers, as well as polluting the MAC address table.\nBasically, if you create a loop in the network, you'll know about it, either through monitoring (detecting a change in the STP topology [you do have monitoring, right?]), or in everything falling over dramatically.   \nIf you look at a switch that has a broadcast storm on it, you tend to find that all of the port activity lights are blinking all at the same time."}
{"prompt":"In Greek mythology, the words \"Titan\" and \"God\" seem to be used interchangeably. For example, Zeus is a God, but Cronus (his father) was a Titan. So what is the difference between a Titan and a God in Greek mythology? ","response":"A 'god' is synonymous to a 'deity'; the Titans and Titanesses were gods, they were members of the second order of divine beings - after Gaia and Uranus, and the other primordial deities.\n\nCronus and his fellow Titans comprised the second Ancient Greek pantheon (the first comprising of deities such as Ananke, Gaea, and Ouranos), which the younger generation of gods, including Zeus, would later usurp, as the Titans usurped the primordial gods before them. (For more information on this concept of change in dominant deities, read up on the theory of The Golden Age, particularly that of Hesiod, who also wrote the only surviving account of the Titans in his Theogony.)\n\nAs for why the Titans have their own order name as opposed to Zeus et al who are simply 'gods', there is debate as to the exact etymology of the word 'titan' but this quote from Hesiod's Theogony states:\n\n&quot;But these sons whom he begot himself great Heaven used to call Titans （Strainers） in reproach, for he said that they strained  (τιταίνοντας) and did presumptuous a fearful deed, and that vengeance (τίσιν) for it would come afterwards.&quot;\nTrans.

{"prompt":"What is the difference between kerning vs. letter spacing?","response":"Any font has built-in spacing determined by the “side bearing” of each character. In metal type, the side bearing is the physical right or left edge of the individual piece of type that determines its spacing from the characters on either side. Digital fonts mimic this in the basic design process.\n\n* “To kern” means to adjust the spacing between a pair of letters, numerals, punctuation, etc.  (properly “glyphs”) so that their spacing looks correct. The letters AV, for example, have to overlap in any usual typeface, otherwise at least one of them ends up looking lost and bewildered. Their kerning is tightened to snug them up to one another. An italic f will collide with a following question or quote mark in some fonts, so the kerning must be opened up from the default spacing.\n\nAn ancient scribe could kern effortlessly with pen and ink, and if you read old manuscripts you'll see lots of places where a letter intrudes into the space of the one next to it. With metal type, it wasn't so easy. Kerning required cutting away some of the metal base, or table, of the character. The amount of time, skill and work involved is left as an exercise for readers whose minds are in need of a little boggling. The shapes of the letters in metal type intended for long passages of text such as books, or especially newspapers, were designed to minimize the amount of kerning that would be necessary.\n\nKerning tables built into a digital font assign preset kerning values to specific letter pairs, according to the designer's best estimate of how they should look. There can be a dozen or so pairs (or none!) in a cheapo font, thousands in a high-end one. No matter how thoroughly and well a kerning table is built, though, there will still be situations where some awkward combination requires that the kerning be loosened or tightened from the preset values of the glyphs.\n\n* Letter spacing (often “tracking” in software applications) adjusts the spacing between all the glyphs in a piece of text. This can help to make a page look a little more open and inviting, for example, especially with a similarly open leading. Very large type, such as a big headline, almost always benefits from tightening the tracking. Tiny type, such as in captions or footnotes, is made more readable by opening the letter spacing a bit, especially if the paper is absorbent and will allow the ink to spread a little.\n\nA final note: Use caution with both kerning and tracking. Tracking is very often wildly overdone, kerning is seldom done enough."}

{"prompt":"How to make ricotta cheese?","response":"Ricotta cheese, the delicious key ingredient in Italian dishes from lasagna to cannoli, is simple to make in your own kitchen. Homemade ricotta cheese requires just a few ingredients, and the result is lighter and fresher than store-bought cheese. See Step 1 and beyond to learn how to make a batch today.\n\n## Milk-based ricotta\n\n1. Prepare the strainer. Line the fine-mesh strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth, and set it over the nonreactive bowl. Set this contraption on your work surface so to have it ready for the cheese mixture. If you don't use cheesecloth, it will be difficult to separate the cheese curds from the whey. You can substitute a double layer of paper towels or a thin cotton dishcloth in a pinch.\n2. Heat the milk, cream and salt. Place the milk, cream and salt in the saucepan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Allow it to heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. When the mixture is hot enough, turn off the heat and move the saucepan so the milk can begin to cool. It should take about 5 minutes to reach the correct temperature. Stir the mixture as it's heating to prevent it from scorching on the bottom. Use your candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to determine whether the mixture has reached the right temperature. If you don't let it cook long enough, the curds won't separate from the whey. If you overcook it, the texture will be ruined.\n3. Slowly add the vinegar. Use one hand to stir constantly while the other hand slowly pours the vinegar into the heated milk and cream mixture. The vinegar will cause the curds to coagulate and separate from the whey. You'll see solid bits forming and floating to the top of the liquid. Keep stirring until all of the vinegar has been added. The curdling agent in this case is vinegar, but some people prefer to use other substances. Try substituting 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice for a different flavor. For a more traditional touch, try using animal rennet as your coagulant. Mix 1 teaspoon of rennet with 1\/4 cup of cold water, then stir it into the milk mixture.\n4. Let the mixture sit until it's thick. Wait about 10 - 20 minutes for the coagulant to go to work and cause the curds to separate from the whey. It's ready when the curds have floated to the top to form a thick layer, leaving the liquid whey underneath.\n5. Ladle the curds into the strainer. Scoop out the thick top layer of curds and ladle them over the cheesecloth-covered strainer. Keep ladling out the curds until all that's left in the saucepan is the whey. You can discard the whey at this point.\n6. Let the ricotta drain. Wait at least an hour for the last of the whey to drain from the ricotta through the cheesecloth into the bowl. It will take about half an hour for the ricotta to fully drain. Don't attempt to stir it or push it through the cheesecloth, as this will just push the curds into the cloth. If you'd like a creamier final product, stop draining the ricotta after 5 - 10 minutes. For a drier final product, wait an hour for it to drain.\n7. Spoon the ricotta into a bowl. The finished ricotta is now ready to use in your favorite recipe. It's delicious as part of a savory dish or a dessert. Ricotta will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\n\n\n## Whey-based ricotta\n\n1. Save the whey from making cheese in a non-reactive pot. When you make homemade cheese, you'll have curds at the bottom of the pot, and you'll pour off the whey. Filter as many of the curd particles out as you can since they would otherwise form tough \"beads\" in the final ricotta. Cover the whey and let it sit for at least 12 hours at room temperature to develop sufficient acidity. Acidified whey acts as its own coagulant, making it unnecessary to add vinegar or lemon juice to separate the curds.\n2. Heat the acidified whey. Pour it into a saucepan and heat it while stirring, taking care to avoid sticking or burning. Heat until the temperature has risen to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and a white appears on the surface. Continue heating and stirring until the temperature reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Note that the foam will build up somewhat. Be careful. If it boils, it can boil over.\n3. Remove the whey from heat and wait for it to curdle. Cover it and allow it to cool undisturbed until comfortable to the touch. The curds will soon appear like clouds suspended in the whey, while the whey will be clear and yellowish green.\n4. Strain the ricotta. Do not stir up the curd. Instead, set up a receiving pot with a large strainer and a fine clean cloth on top. Ladle the curds into the cloth, leaving the whey in the saucepan. Discard the whey. Be sure to scoop out the curds gently. Because the curds are very fine and delicate, they can stop up the cloth easily. This will cause very slow draining if they are broken up.\n5. Drain the whey through the cloth. It can take 2-3 hours for the whey to completely drain. If you prefer, you can set the strainer in the refrigerator and let it drain overnight.\n6. Remove the ricotta from the cloth. Pack it into a container, cover it and store in the refrigerator. Use it soon after making. Ricotta will keep up to a week in the refrigerator. Alternatively, ricotta freezes very well.\n"}

But leave out the names so that the readers may guess who the story is about on their own.","response":"There once was a king, in a far-away land.\nNow, this king was a good king, unlike those in many of these tales. He wanted what was best for his kingdom and fought his hardest for that, while the rest of his court was all out for themselves.\nThis king had great plans for his kingdom.

{"prompt":"Assume that I am a programmer and I have an NP-complete problem that I need to solve it. What methods are available to deal with NPC problems? Is there a survey or something similar on this topic?","response":"There are a number of well-studied strategies; which is best in your application depends on circumstance.\n\n* Improve worst case runtime\nUsing problem-specific insight, you can often improve the naive algorithm. For instance, there are $O(c^n)$ algorithms for Vertex Cover with $c huge improvement over the naive $\\Omega(2^n)$ and might make instance sizes relevant for you tractable.\n\n* Improve expected runtime\nUsing heuristics, you can often devise algorithms that are fast on many instances. If those include most that you meet in practice, you are golden. Examples are SAT for which quite involved solvers exist, and the Simplex algorithm (which solves a polynomial problem, but still). One basic technique that is often helpful is branch and bound.\n\n* Restrict the problem\nIf you can make more assumptions on your inputs, the problem may become easy.\n\n* Structural properties\nYour inputs may have properties that simplify solving the problem, e.g. planarity, bipartiteness or missing a minor for graphs. See here for some examples of graph classes for which CLIQUE is easy.  \n\n* Bounding functions of the input\nAnother thing to look at is parameterised complexity; some problems are solvable in time $O(2^kn^m)$ for $k$ some instance parameter (maximum node degree, maximum edge weight, ...) and $m$ constant. If you can bound $k$ by a polylogarithmic function in $n$ in your setting, you get polynomial algorithms. Saeed Amiri gives details in his answer.\n\n* Bounding input quantities\nFurthermore, some problems admit algorithms that run in pseudo-polynomial time, that is their runtime is bounded by a polynomial function in a number that is part of the input; the naive primality check is an example. This means that if the quantities encoded in your instances have reasonable size, you might have simple algorithms that behave well for you.\n\n* Weaken the result\nThis means that you tolerate errorneous or incomplete results. There are two main flavors:\n\n* Probabilistic algorithms\nYou only get the correct result with some probability. There are some variants, most notable Monte-Carlo and Las-Vegas algorithms. A famous example is the Miller-Rabin primality test.\n\n* Approximation algorithms\nYou no longer look for optimal solutions but almost optimal ones. Some algorithms admit relative (\"no worse than double the optimum\"), others absolute (\"no worse than $5$ plus the optimum\") bounds on the error. For many problems it is open how well they can be approximated. There are some that can be approximated arbitrarily well in polynomial time, while others are known to not allow that; check the theory of polynomial-time approximation schemes.\n\nRefer to Algorithmics for Hard Problems by Hromkovič for a thorough treatment.\n* Simplicity is beauty: Improved upper bounds for vertex cover by Chen Jianer, Iyad A.

{"prompt":"How to keep dogs safe on the fourth of july?","response":"## Beforehand\n\n1. Ensure that your pet’s information is up to date. Many dogs escape when they are startled by fireworks. If your pet doesn’t have a collar with a tag that has contact information on it, as well as a microchip with your current information, now is the time to get them. Your collar should fit securely but comfortably; it should be snug enough that it won’t be easily caught on a branch or other such thing, but not so tight as to make it uncomfortable for your dog to wear it. Be certain that it doesn't restrict your dog’s airflow – you should be able to fit two fingers between your dog’s collar and neck. There should be a tag that ensures the dog does not have rabies and another with your name and phone number on it. A microchip is a tiny transponder that uses radiofrequency waves to transmit information on the chip about your pet when scanned. It is implemented painlessly just under the skin using a large-bore needle by veterinarians and some shelters. Once your dog has a microchip, you must register with the company the microchip is made by; now, if your dog arrives at a shelter, (s)he will be scanned and the microchip will give the shelter your phone number to contact you with. Your microchip must have recent contact information; if it does not, simply contact the microchip company to update your information.\n2. Brush up on your dog’s training. Your dog should have basic obedience training, and should easily respond to you. The most vital commands to train are walking on a leash, “come,” and “leave it,” in addition to crate training. If your puppy is young and hasn’t been leash trained, and you intend to bring the dog to parades\/parties\/fireworks displays, now is the time to do this. For information on leash training, read this wikiHow article. Your recall command should be rock-solid. If your dog runs off in reaction to fireworks, or after an interesting smell, you must be able to recall him. A related command is “stay”; for information on teaching this, read this article. During parties or parades, your dog is likely to come across yummy food that’s unhealthy for him to eat. To prevent him from eating anything he shouldn't, your “leave it” command should be very good. Another useful, related command is “drop it”; for information on teaching this, read this article. A crate is a useful tool during 4th of July celebrations, serving both to safely contain the dog and often calm him\/her. For information on crate training, read this article.\n3. Plan your party carefully. Choose decorations carefully – glow sticks, which are both toxic for dogs and enticingly similar to colorful chew toys, are particularly dangerous. As beer and other human food and drink are toxic for dogs, decide on a place to keep your dog(s) during the party, such as in the house if the party is in the yard. If the dog is friendly and would like to stay with the people, consider keeping him with you leashed; contained by keeping him in a room with a baby gate barring passage if the party is inside; or securely tying him to a tree, fence, or other secure object if the party is outside. Before the party, research what foods are toxic to dogs. For information on avoiding foods toxic to dogs, read this article.\n4. Contact a veterinarian. For owners of dogs that are extremely reactive to fireworks or other typical Independence Day activities, the best option may be to discuss ways to help your dog with an experienced veterinarian. Topics to discuss include reducing stress for older dogs and the option of sedating the dog using safe drugs.\n5. Consider moving your dog. If your dog is extremely stressed by Independence Day activities, the best option may be to move him to another place for the duration of the celebrations or during the most active part (such as a parade). It may be possible to locate a “doggy hotel,” friend or relative in a quiet rural area willing to keep the dog; however, expect there to be at least some amount of fireworks or parties, and it can be difficult to locate a business or person willing to care for your dog during the celebrations.\n6. Investigate products that may serve to calm your dog. A commercial product of “anxiety wrap,” has been used with great success. Created by behavioral experts, such an item can calm dogs in a manner similar to swaddling an infant. A crate can be very useful, as stated above. As wolves naturally occupied dens, a dog will find comfort in his own “den,” or a crate. To increase the darkness, cover the crate with a blanket, leaving part of it uncovered so the dog can see passing people and breathe fresh air. It is possible to purchase relaxing auditory CDs that have been clinically researched to calm anxious dogs; these can be helpful for calming dogs frightened by Independence Day celebrations. Ask your veterinarian for more advice.\n\n\n## Party\n\n1. Secure your dog in the pre-decided place, if applicable. If he is going into a crate, place the crate in a quiet area of the house and put a safe bone, favorite toy, or other treats inside to occupy the dog. The dog will go in for the treat; once he or she is in, drape a dark-colored blanket over the crate to create darkness. Praise him and close windows and doors; you can also play a TV, radio, iPod, etc. to cover the sound of the party, or use the soothing music. If the dog is staying in the house, choose a room where the dog will be able to see the people but which people will not enter (for example, an office or study). Leave something to keep him occupied, and consider playing music\/etc.\n2. If the dog will be staying with you, keep him away from food. Avoid tables, where scraps can lay or food can sit tantalizingly close. If a guest offers your dog food, politely inform your guest that human food can be toxic for dogs and that you would prefer for your dog not to eat any. Guests, especially children, might ask you if they can walk or pet the dog; if they do, tell them that feeding the dog food is not allowed. Do not leave the dog unattended – this is particularly dangerous outside, where stray fireworks can land or the dog can bolt from if fireworks go off or there is another loud noise.\n3. Stay calm and alert. You’ll want to be on the lookout for anything that could scare your dog, but keep in mind that your dog can sense your emotions and will often copy them. For example: If you’re on edge and nervous, your dog will sense this and be on edge and nervous as well. Clearly, you can’t control your guests’ behavior, but take the following precautions:\n\t* Stay aware of the effect of the party’s tone on your dog. If your dog starts to become anxious or overly active, the best option can be to put him in a separate room, crate, etc. Ask kids to play away from your dog. Children running around can be especially upsetting for a dog, and it’s a good idea to ask any kids upsetting your dog to quiet down or play in a separate area.\n4. Watch out for stray fireworks. These are an unfortunate danger in places where fireworks have been set off or have been set off nearby, and it’s wise to stay on guard for any, as fireworks are unpredictable and can be highly dangerous.\n\n\n## Parade\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. Parades can be stressful, and often the best option is to leave him at home in a crate or room, as described in the section on parties. If you don’t want to leave your dog alone, another option is to leave him with friends or family not attending. However, if you do decide to bring your dog with you, follow the steps below to keep your dog as calm and safe as possible.\n2. Purchase or gather the supplies you may need. These include:\n\t* A crate for securing your dog. A secure leash and collar. A harness or controlling item such as a head collar might be preferred, as your dog may pull. A muzzle. This is a necessary safety precaution, as the sights and sounds of a parade can distress your dog to the point of biting. A collapsible water bowl and water. Your pet must be kept hydrated, as should you.\n3. Introduce your dog to the parade gradually. Though you likely won’t be able to follow through a complete desensitization due to lack of time, you can introduce your dog gradually – at first, simply allow him to adjust to the sight, smell, and noise of the crowd at a closer and closer distance, and the parade using the same rules.\n4. Keep your dog under control. You should only bring a dog to a parade if he has been obedience trained, but even if he has been, keep a closer eye on your dog than usual. Watch for signs that your dog is uneasy or upset; if the parade upsets your dog too much, you can take him away from the parade or, if possible, set up a crate in a secure location.\n5. Keep your dog as safe as possible. Keeping your dog in a car is never a safe option, as the heat can give your dog heatstroke – or even kill him – and water must be provided regularly to prevent heat stroke and keep your dog hydrated. Read this article for information on treating heat stroke.\n\n\n## Firework show\n\n1. Consider leaving your dog at home. As with parades, fireworks can be upsetting and even dangerous for dogs. Dogs who are startled by them can run off and escape, and, even if they have an up-to-date tag and microchip, are not guaranteed to be found or returned. Optionally, you can consult a veterinarian for information on drugging your dog, but in general, bringing your dog is discouraged, and should only be done if your dog:\n\t* Has heard fireworks before and did not strongly react to them;\n\t* Has an up-to-date tag and microchip;\n\t* Has basic obedience training; “come” in particular must be rock-solid; and\n\t* Is calm around crowds, playing kids, other dogs, and various other features of fireworks.\n2. Gather your supplies. These are the same as in the section on parades.\n3. Train your dog. If your dog appears anxious, do not reassure him – this will reward him for bad behavior, as in essence he is receiving a yummy treat when he is afraid, telling him that he should be afraid. Instead, give him attention and a treat whenever he is calm; you are now telling him that being calm is good. Use small treats easily swallowed with a strong scent to distract the dog.\n4. Keep an eye on your dog. Signs of anxiety include the dog licking his lips, whimpering, a tense position, and showing the whites of his eyes; if these occur, quietly and calmly remove the dog from the situation. Keep your dog hydrated; bring along a collapsible water bowl and bottles of water and offer water to your dog occasionally. Keep in mind that he may be too stressed to drink – if this happens, the best option may be to remove your dog from the situation. If your dog is calm, you can distract him with treats, a Kong toy stuffed with peanut butter, a favorite toy, or any other desirable object.\n5. Be prepared to leave. If your dog is too stressed by the fireworks, the best option is to immediately leave for your home. If you’re attending the fireworks with others, tell them in advance that you may have to leave if your dog becomes too anxious. At home, have a crate set up in the same manner described in the section on parties. Keep in mind that a car is not a safe option for putting your dog in, as the heat levels can kill him\/her; instead, the safest option is to leave with your dog and place him in the crate. Once he’s settled in, you can return to the fireworks and have fun.\n"}
{"prompt":"You are a journalist. Everything you write becomes true. One day, not knowing this, you decide to write some satire.","response":"I lean back in the comfortable chair and exhale the smoke of the cigarette. Grey clouds of smoke wander around in the room and for a moment I close my eyes. What a night: finally managed to finish the new book.\nIt was good to write something silly once in a while. Usually I pick a topic and research, write a book on it only to discover that things get even worse. Not this time!\nA parody, Satire, something funny.\nEven writing the damn thing was fun as hell, just take the strangest and most hilarious idea you have and make it the premise of the book.\nAnd here it was my take on the United States presidential election ..."}
{"prompt":"Why doesn't the nuclear fusion in a star make it explode?","response":"The fusion that occurs in the core of the Sun occurs in nothing like the conditions you might be thinking of in a bomb, or a fusion reactor. In particular, it occurs at much lower temperatures and at a much lower rate. A cubic metre of material in the solar core is only releasing around 250 W of power by fusion.\nThe fusion rate is set by the temperature (and to a lesser extent, density) of the core. This in turn is set by the need for a pressure gradient to balance the weight of material pressing down on it from above. At 15 million kelvin (the core temperature, which is much lower than the temperatures in nuclear bombs or fusion reactors), the average proton has a lifetime of several billion years before being converted (with three others) into a helium nucleus. There are two reasons this is slow. First, you have to get protons, which repel each other electromagnetically, close enough together to feel the strong nuclear force. This is why high temperatures are needed. Second, because the diproton is unstable, one of the protons needs to change into a neutron via a weak force interaction, whilst it is in the unstable diproton state, to form a deuterium nucleus. This is just inherently unlikely and means the overall reaction chain to helium is very slow.\nThe reason there is no bomb-like explosion is because there is no problem in shifting 250 W per cubic metre away from the core, in the same way that a compost heap, which generates about the same power density, does not spontaneously explode. In the case of a star any additional heat goes into more radiation that diffuses away and in work done in expanding the star. As a result, the temperature of the core is stable.  Ultimately, any additional energy emerges as sunlight at the solar photosphere.\nIf for some reason, the opacity to radiation in the core increased, then the temperature would rise and more energy would be generated by fusion. This is exactly what happens in the core as more hydrogen is turned into helium; the core temperature and luminosity do rise, but slowly, on timescales of billions of years."}

{"prompt":"Border around formatted text in Inkscape","response":"Here is solution step by step:\n\n* Create some flowed text by using the text tool to first drag a rectangle and then type.\n* Separately, create a rectangle roughly around the text (really, the rectangle can be anywhere)\n* With the rectangle selected, chose \"Path\" > \"Linked Offset\". Then grab the small diamond and drag it in to make a second, smaller rectangle. \n* Select the text and the smaller rectangle and choose \"Text\" > \"Flow into frame\". Then select the smaller rectangle and remove the stroke to make it invisible. Now the text will flow within the smaller (invisible) rectangle, which is dynamically linked to the shape of the larger (visible) rectangle. \n* Then, if you like, you can add a small border radius on the visible rectangle and you get this nice looking result. \n* If you do need to modify the space between the text and the rectangle, you can carefully select it by grabbing it with the text and the subtracting the text from the selection, or you can drill down to it within the XML Editor. When you do get it selected, then you can adjust the margin.\n* Finally, group the text and the two rectangles, and you're all set! "}
{"prompt":"In Django, the convention is to put all of your static files (i.e css, js) specific to your app into a folder called static. So the structure would look like this:\n```mysite\/\n    manage.py\n    mysite\/ --> (settings.py, etc)\n    myapp\/ --> (models.py, views.py, etc)\n        static\/\n```\nIn ```mysite\/settings.py``` I have:\n```STATIC_ROOT = 'staticfiles'\n```\nSo when I run the command:\n```python manage.py collectstatic\n```\nIt creates a folder called ```staticfiles``` at the root level (so same directory as ```myapp\/```)\nWhat's the point of this? Isn't it just creating a copy of all my static files?","response":"## Collect static files from multiple apps into a single path\n\nA single Django project may use several apps, so while there you only have one ```myapp```, it may actually be ```myapp1```, ```myapp2```, etc\nBy copying them from inside the individual apps into a single folder, you can point your frontend web server (e.g. nginx) to that single folder ```STATIC_ROOT``` and serve static files from a single location, rather than configure your web server to serve static files from multiple paths.\n\n## Persistent URLs with ManifestStaticFilesStorage\n\nA note about the MD5 hash being appended to the filename for versioning: It's not part of the default behavior of ```collectstatic```, as ```settings.STATICFILES_STORAGE``` defaults to ```StaticFilesStorage``` (which doesn't do that)\nThe MD5 hash will kick in e.g. if you set it to use ```ManifestStaticFilesStorage```, which adds that behavior.\n\n> The purpose of this storage is to keep serving the old files in case some pages still refer to those files, e.g. because they are cached by you or a 3rd party proxy server. Additionally, it’s very helpful if you want to apply far future Expires headers to the deployed files to speed up the load time for subsequent page visits."}
