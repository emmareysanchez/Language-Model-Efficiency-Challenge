{"prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise.

We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by a, resulting in the equation (a + b) = ac. Now we can subtract b from both sides, getting (a - b) + b = a + b - b = a.
